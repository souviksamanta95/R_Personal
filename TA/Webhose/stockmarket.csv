"Ever since the Covid-19 pandemic struck the country, Prakash Kumar, an III-T graduate and founder of start-up KhaaliJeb, has been doing the rounds of offices of venture capital (VC) firms to raise funds for his bootstrapped banking app for the youth. He’s been turned down by 10 VCs so far.
“Pre-2016, a lot of young start-up founders were raising funds. But doing so has become difficulty now for new start-up founders. Most of the funds are being raised by second-time founders or those who have a corporate trail,” said Kumar, who has been bootstrapping KhaaliJeb for two years.
Many start-ups, particularly in India, are funded only if they have founders from the IITs, say players. “But fresh ideas don’t necessarily come from the IITs and then it becomes difficult for such ventures to see the light of day,” said Ashok Kadsur, co-founder of SignDesk, a digital start-up that is in the process of raising its first funding.

With the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) including start-ups in the priority sector lending (PSL) group, these companies now see hope. “This opens up a new avenue of capital, especially in the early stages when many founders struggle to convince a small pool of investors to raise Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore to start their companies. As a result, they have limited sources other than friends and family,” said Anup Jain, managing partner, Orios Venture Partners.
There have been instances when start-up founders have had to mortgage their houses to secure bank loans. So, to be able to simply walk into a bank and get a PSL at 8-10 per cent is a dream for any start-up founder who has to otherwise rely on costly debt from venture capitalists.
According to Tracxn, funding activity in the start-up ecosystem fell by nearly 29 per cent to $4.2 billion in the first six months of this year compared to $5.9 billion in the same period last year. This is due to the impact of the Covid pandemic. Only 443 companies were funded in the January-June period this year against 725 in the corresponding period in 2019.
Segments such as internet of things (IoT) and health care would certainly gain from this step by the RBI, says Sanjay Swamy, managing partner at Prime Venture Partners. However, banks might not consider start-ups in areas such as the stock market and trading as these are seen as a speculative activity.

“Procuring an unsecured or a secured loan looks highly implausible because of this outlook. It really depends on where the start-ups operate,” said Tejas Khoday, co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of bootstrapped brokerage start-up Fyers. “All start-ups can't be painted with the same brush. Asset-heavy businesses such as renewable energy may get preference.”
This development also comes with some riders as borrowing from banks has its own risks. Banks will have to understand the high-growth business models of the start-up ecosystem and how to underwrite them.
The priority lending tag could also help India become self-reliant in start-up funding. Of the $14 billion raised by start-ups from VCs in the year ending December 2019, roughly only $1 billion came from Indian sources. “Now, banks and financial institutions will unleash rupee capital into the ecosystem. We may become self-reliant in terms of start-up funding than being completely and inordinately reliant on foreign capital and external funding due to regulations,” said Siddarth Pai, founding partner at early-stage VC fund 3one4 Capital.
“There are enough debt funds overseas and a few in India that have come up over the last 4-5 years. We strongly feel this will open up opportunities for debt funds,” added Ashish Fafadia, Partner at early stage VC Blume Ventures."

"MUMBAI: Despite a status quo in key lending rates, the Indian equity indices made healthy gains on Thursday.
The gains came on the back of the Reserve Bank's positive outlook and accommodative stance in its monetary policy decision.
The equity market opened gap up and remained positive for most part of the session.
In terms of global indices, major Asian markets closed on a mixed note, while European indices like the FTSE, CAC and DAX have ended lower.
Sector-wise, the top gainers were the BSE IT, FMCG, CD and Metal indices, whereas BSE Telecom, Capital Goods and Power indices lost ground.
The Nifty50 on the National Stock Exchange closed at 11,200.15, higher by 98.50 points or 0.89 per cent from its previous close. Similarly, the S&P BSE Sensex closed at 38,025.45, gaining 362.12 points or 0.96 per cent from its previous close of 37,663.33. It opened at 37,946.80 points and touched an intra-day high of 38,221.40 and a low of 37,755.10.
""Technically, with the Nifty remaining in uptrend after a volatile session on the back of the RBI monetary policy event, we expect the Nifty to move higher in the coming sessions,"" said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities.
""The uptrend could accelerate once the immediate highs of 11,257 are cleared. Crucial supports to watch for any trend reversal are at 11,064.""
Jasani also pointed out that banking stocks reacted positively to the MPC outcome despite no rate cut as the feared extension of moratorium has not happened and they will be spared of the requirement of high provisions if by September 30, the new committee's recommendations are implemented.
""The overall market is also excited by the prudent measures implemented. However, the markets lack triggers and or flows to take it higher and hence, may keep running into resistances,"" Jasani said.
According to Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services: ""Indian benchmark indices came off highs but still closed out a volatile day with gains, following RBI commentary regarding interest rate outlook.""
Siddhartha Khemka, Head, Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said: ""The market might continue its positive movement in the near term, with more stock specific action as the earnings season progresses. Investors would now be awaiting announcement of US stimulus which could bring cheer to the market.""
""However we find the risk-reward unattractive at the current levels and we would advise investors to remain defensive in their portfolio approach. Traders, on the other hand, are advised to stay cautious and keep booking profit at regular intervals.""
On Thursday, the Reserve Bank retained its key short-term lending rates, but maintained its growth-oriented accommodative stance. Accordingly, the Monetary Policy Committee of the central bank maintained the repo rate or short-term lending rate for commercial banks, at 4 per cent. Likewise, the reverse repo rate stands unchanged at 3.35 per cent. (IANS)

A sustainable move above 11,250 could pull Nifty towards the 11,350-11,400 range over the next week,” said Nagaraj Shetti, technical research analyst, HDFC Securities. “Immediate support to be watched is at 11,100 and an important lower support for trend reversal is placed at 10,900,” he said."

Many of us have thought about investing money and buying shares into numerous global brands or start-up companies. There are tons of stories of how people managed to make millions of dollars in profits by just investing a small amount. Even though there are certain risks involved, the prizes can be tremendous, but it all depends on your will.
The good thing about buying and selling shares is that thanks to the Internet, the process can be done online, at the comfort of your home. All you have to do is register at certain sites, deposit money and start trading. This article is meant to help you decide where should you invest your money. These are hard times and not every country's market is stable. Of course, there are several things that you need to do before investing your money, and we are going to touch that topic as well.
Things to Know Before Trading
The first thing that you need to know before trading is the amount that you wish to invest. Putting all of your money on the line is not a good choice because you need to have a plan B in case the investment falls through. Research is also a key ‘ingredient’ in the process. The more time you spend researching and educating yourself on the markets and the process of trading, the smarter your decision will be.
One of the best pieces of advice that many experts have given is that it is not smart to invest all of your money in one place. It’s much better to diversify. As you know, global markets fluctuate up and down every day and if you have your money in several places, the chances of being profitable are increased.
You should also be realistic with yourself. This is especially important when thinking of the amount that you want to invest as well as the profit that you plan on gaining. Too often, people set impossible goals when it comes to the profit and when the results come, they are disappointed. Lastly, patience is the key – profits don’t happen overnight, you need to wait and be patient with your investments.
Now let’s check out some of the most stable markets at the moment.
New Zealand
New Zealand was among the first countries that managed to handle the pandemic in a very efficient and effective way. Even though the virus had a certain impact on their market and economy, it was far easier for them to handle the situation. The reason for that is because they acted swiftly and precisely. As of July 2020, the New Zealand stock exchange market is in our top 3 shortlist as one of the most stable in the world. Buyshares.co.nz has the best guide on how to research and buy shares in the NZ stock exchange market, so give them a read if you are interested.
The United Kingdom
Even though the UK is among the most impacted countries in Europe, its market remains one of the most popular when it comes to investing money. The reason for that is because the prices for the shares have gone down since the beginning of the crisis. This is the perfect sign for all investors who have been looking to get their hands in British businesses. Statistics have shown that they are extremely popular and that is why thousands of people invest in them each day.
Denmark
You simply knew that a Nordic country would be featured on this list. Each Nordic country is years ahead from the rest of the world when it comes to being innovative, serving the people, and making investments. Denmark is the most stable out of all the countries in that region. Up until a while ago, Sweden also had a stable market, but after they failed to deal with the pandemic, their market has gone down.
Their experts have admitted that they should’ve developed a better strategy to deal with it which is why they have to deal with the consequences today.
Some other notable mentions are Latvia, Croatia, Slovenia, Portugal, and Australia. All of these countries have been ranked high on the list of the best stock markets at the moment. » More TMCnet Feature Articles"

Some highlights of the week: Pricing levels on coronavirus vaccines are coming into view , digital health saw its largest-ever deal ( Telavongo! ), and a buzzy primary-care startup went public .

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson Teladoc is acquiring Livongo in the biggest deal that digital health has ever seen. Here are the 3 key takeaways from Wall Street's top analysts, from shock at the price tag to optimism for healthcare's digital future. Digital health companies have certainly not let a good crisis go to waste. And the coronavirus has turned into a doozy of a crisis.
Teladoc Health and Livongo Health have both seen surges in demand for their services — and stocks — stemming from the pandemic. Now, Teladoc is buying Livongo in the largest-ever deal for the growing digital health industry. It's an open debate as to whether Teladoc overpaid or made a savvy deal to create a force in digital health. As BI's Blake Dodge reports, analysts think this deal ""could prove to be more significant than the oft-touted ambitions of tech giants like Amazon."" Advertisement But the interests of tech giants still hover over the entire space. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have seized opportunities presented by the pandemic to move ahead in entering the $3.6 trillion US healthcare industry , Blake writes. As health systems go to the cloud and medical care moves online, the tech giants are offering a combination of tools and scale to play a role.

Andrew Harnik/AP Images Advertisement Moderna has already struck deals to sell small quantities of its coronavirus vaccine for almost twice as much as rival shots. Here's how the upstart biotech is thinking about pricing its vaccine. A pricing controversy is brewing in the coronavirus vaccine race .
Some pharma giants have pledged not to profit off their vaccines during the pandemic, with the US government effectively paying $4 per dose for AstraZeneca's vaccine and $10 per shot for Johnson & Johnson's .
Moderna and Pfizer , on the other hand, have been clear they want to make a business out of their vaccines, while still vowing to behave responsibly . Pfizer reached a deal with the US at $19.50 per dose, leaving Moderna as the biggest mystery. Advertisement The Massachusetts biotech gave a clue on its earnings call this week, disclosing the company has already sold small quantities to other countries priced between $32 and $37 per dose . Moderna executives said large-quantity deals will carry a lower price. How much lower? That remains to be seen. Pricing debates may be getting a bit ahead of the actual research. We still don't know if any of the shots will work at preventing infection or disease. Morgan Stanley analysts are modeling that pivotal results will likely come for Moderna, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca in roughly three months .
You can read the full story here>> TIMELINE: Morgan Stanley says we should know if a coronavirus vaccine works by November. Here's how the bank expects the race for a cure to play out. That timeframe aligns amazingly close to the November elections. President Donald Trump is already highlighting the fact a vaccine could be ready before Election Day . Advertisement The specifics matter here: It's possible to have data by then that shows an experimental shot works. But it's also exceedingly unlikely a vaccine will be widely available in 2020, given the massive manufacturing and distribution challenges.
Operation Warp Speed's own goal is having 300 million doses by January 2021. Keep in mind these leading vaccines are two-dose regimens, so reaching that aspirational goal equates to roughly 150 million treatment courses next January. In other words, less than half the US population. Beyond the immediate frontrunners, there are over 160 coronavirus vaccine programs in the works . Novavax, a small Maryland biotech, also released the first look at human data for its program , which appeared to show promising early results. The company plans to launch a large efficacy-focused trial this fall.

"Reuters The US Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday said the US added 1.8 million jobs in July. That exceeded the 1.5 million payroll additions expected by economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The report marks the third straight month of job gains since the US saw record payroll losses in April as part of the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic . The BLS also said the US unemployment rate was 10.2% in July, down from 11.1% in June. The US economy added jobs for a third straight month in July, reflecting the nation's attempts to reopen and claw back from the devastating coronavirus recession.
American businesses added 1.8 million nonfarm payrolls during the month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . That exceeded the 1.5 million payroll additions expected by economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
The US unemployment rate came in at 10.2%, the BLS said, lower than the 10.6% expected by economists. It was also down from 11.1% in May. April's 14.7% reading was the highest since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Advertisement Read more: MORGAN STANLEY: The government's recession response has the stock market heading for a massive upheaval. Here's your best strategy to capitalize on the shift. ""Joblessness is still tremendously high, but it is moving in the right direction,"" said Nick Bunker, an economist at Indeed.
The data comes amid a crucial time as the US tries to recover from the damage caused by the virus, which triggered the worst recession since the Great Depression. Recent spikes in coronavirus cases have forced some states to pause or roll back their reopening plans, threatening a swift recovery. Advertisement Inside the numbers Employment ticked up across most industries and sectors, according to the Friday report. The biggest gain was in leisure and hospitality, which rose by 529,000 in July, accounting for one-third of the gain in payrolls during the month.
Retail trade, professional and business services, healthcare, social assistance, manufacturing, and transportation jobs also gained in July. Construction jobs were little changed from a month earlier, and mining was the only sector to shed jobs in the period.

The BLS noted that generally, public-sector education employment falls in July before seasonal adjustments. Because these layoffs and furloughs happened earlier in the year because of the coronavirus pandemic, the July increases in local government education and state education were ""unusually large,"" according to the report.
The number of people on temporary layoff decreased by 1.3 million in July and is now 9.2 million, roughly half the April level. Permanent job losses were little changed from the previous month, standing at 2.9 million in July. The level of permanent job losses is important to watch, as those who are not on temporary layoff have a harder time finding new employment.
Signs of weakness remain Even with the better-than-expected data, there are some lingering signs of weakness in the labor market. US employment still remains nearly 13 million below the February level, according to the report. Advertisement Further, numerous indicators throughout July flashed warning signs that the economic recovery had lost momentum. High-frequency indicators such as data from Homebase — a scheduling app used by small businesses — and the Dallas Fed Mobility index, showed less growth in the number of people returning to work and participating in economic activity.

"Spencer Platt/Getty Images The stock market is set to continue moving higher in 2020, as ""maximum liquidity"" is all that matters, according to a Bank of America note published on Friday. But under the surface, there's plenty to be bearish about as low yields incite a bubble in stocks just as Main Street enters a recession, BofA said. Investors should expect stocks to keep moving higher in 2020, but 2021 will be bearish as a COVID-19 vaccine is likely to mark the ""big top,"" according to the note. ""I'm so bearish, I'm bullish,"" BofA's Michael Hartnett said in the note. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . ""I'm so bearish, I'm bullish.""
That's how Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett summed up his thinking on the markets in a note published on Friday, as the S&P 500 is just 1% away from making new all-time highs just as Main Street enters a recession, according to the note.
A ""decade-long backdrop"" of low interest rates, maximum liquidity, and low growth translates to ""maximum"" bullishness, according to BofA, adding that ""nothing matters but liquidity."" Advertisement Strong liquidity, driven by easy-money policies enacted by the Fed, is ""inciting a bubble"" in stocks as it masks the bearish factors that have not been able to shake the current market recovery, Hartnett said. The bearish factors being masked by strong liquidity that BofA named include:
 Advertisement 1. Banks not lending: 71% of loan officers reporting tighter lending standards (the tightest since the fourth quarter of 2008).
2. Governments not spending: With state tax revenues down 30-50% for many states, municipal shortfalls could be greater than $1 trillion in a worse-case scenario. 3. Deficits are soaring: The US federal budget deficit will be at 25% of GDP if the next fiscal stimulus bill in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is greater than $1 trillion, which would be the highest since the World War II peak of 27.5%. Advertisement 4. Fed printing: Central bank stimulus of $9 trillion in 2020 represents a global liquidity supernova that will continue until either a melt-up on Wall Street trickles down into Main Street wages or if the unemployment rates drops below 5% while inflation rises above 2%.
5. Dollar debasing: ""Big inflection points in US Dollar always harbinger of leadership change,"" Hartnett said, adding the US debt and deficits being financed by the Fed balance sheet will lead to ""Japanification"" as the Fed buys more US Treasuries.
Read more: A stock chief for $7.3 trillion BlackRock told us how he's investing to get the best returns — and his top picks for maximum income as Wall Street faces the threat of mass dividend cuts Advertisement All of these bearish points are not enough to derail the current stock market rally, but one thing can, according to Hartnett: a COVID-19 vaccine.
A ""big top"" in 2020 is likely at the time of a successful vaccine, which will lead to ""full capitulation by bears, [and] higher interest rates,"" the note said.
Additionally, historic bear market rallies mean the S&P 500 can top out between 3,300 and 3,600 between now and January. The 3,600 point on the S&P 500 represents 7% upside potential from current levels. Advertisement In sum, Hartnett is bearish, but acknowledged how hard it is to be bearish when record driven liquidity from the Fed continues to help stocks move higher. But 2021 might be a different story, according to Hartnett. ""2021 = Bear: bigger government, smaller world, US dollar debasement ... buy volatility and inflation assets,"" Hartnett concluded.

'Investors need to diversify at least 30% to 50% of their liquid wealth across different markets, asset classes, and instruments across the world.''Do this with proper guidance and advice.''Global investing is complicated, but if done right, is extremely rewarding.' For Indian investors, it is time they looked at global markets and diversify as the opportunities across the world are abundant, Shankar Sharma , vice-chairman and joint managing director at First Global, tells Puneet Wadhwa . After the sharp run since March lows, will the Indian markets consolidate now?
The Indian markets, in fact, have rallied less than some global peers.
India has been part of the global rally and still is much below its all-time highs.
Some other markets, such as those in Taiwan, the United States, and Switzerland are way ahead.
That said, there is more room for upside.
I don't think India will sit out the general uptrend in global markets.
The rally will be led by global factors, rather than domestic developments.
While the pace of the up-move may differ as compared to global markets, directionally we will track global peers. Back home, the rally has been in the absence of earnings growth. Does that worry you?
India has been an underperformer to all global market indices for the last several years.
In 2019, global markets were up on average around 30 per cent.
While we keep getting excited, long-term returns from Indian equities have been below fixed deposit returns for several years now.
Though it is good to think that the markets have done well, but if one expands the lens a bit, returns have been less than the FD rate.
And that is the core problem.
India has underperformed most global peers -- both in rupee and dollar terms. So, where does one invest then?
It is time to look at global markets and diversify.
Opportunities across the world are abundant.
It is not that there are no opportunities in India, but that set has shrunk over time, especially in the last four-five years given various shocks to the system.
Sector after sector has experienced a massive setback over the years on the policy front.
Investors need to diversify at least 30 to 50 per cent of their liquid wealth across different markets, asset classes, and instruments across the world.
Don't just buy another country's exchange-traded fund or other funds.
Do this with proper guidance and advice.
Global investing is complicated, but if done right, is extremely rewarding.
Just as no investor should put all money into one single stock howsoever great that stock is, s/he should not have all investments only in a single country.
Investors need to avoid SCCARS ( single country, single currency, single asset risks ). Does the rural economy have the adequate muscle to pull us out of economic contraction?
It is not all gloom and doom.
The rural economy has held up quite well and we should start appreciating it even more.
This is the segment of the economy that helped India in 2008.
Urban India is a high beta market as it is exposed directly to economic cycles.
Rural India, on the other hand, has a steady pace and it does not fall dramatically like the urban segment.
I hope that rural India does bring us out of this phase.
That said, it will not be a quick road to recovery, but whatever the recovery, it will be driven by rural India. Do you see polarisation getting more entrenched into the markets given the pandemic?
The economic growth even in pre-covid days was concentrated in the hands of a few players.
There is not enough growth all around for everyone to get a share of.
Growth is concentrated in the hands of a few players.
Therefore, the rise of the Indian markets should not be mistaken for a proxy or a barometer for economic growth.
In fact, the stock market in India is more a barometer of economic concentration. How far has the pandemic pushed the earnings recovery?
It is too premature to talk about earnings growth this year.
Most estimates have been proved incorrect since the past few years.
We are, in fact, looking at earnings cut/downgrades, but all will depend on the extent of lockdowns/re-locking. What has been your investment strategy over the past few months?
Our India portfolio management services schemes are the best-performing PMS schemes in India on a year-to-date basis.
Our schemes are about the only ones which are up for the year despite the markets being down year-to-date.
The reason for this was that we avoided most of the damage of March 2020 because we anticipated a reasonable part of the crisis.
And from April, we have participated fully in the big rally in India, as well as globally.
In our funds, among sectors, chemicals and pharma have given us good returns.
The fast-moving consumer goods sector has been patchy and we have not been too aggressive here.
Then there is Reliance Industries, which continues to be a promising story.
In March 2020, mid-caps were down at least 50 per cent from their highs made three years ago.
So, the mid-cap index is due for a rally, which is playing out.
The markets are focusing on the survivors of this pandemic and we are betting on these stocks as well.

"The IPO of Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), the country’s largest company, could create a large base of retail investors. With this, the number of Demat accounts can be increased by 20 crores. Interest in investors is being seen about this IPO.
80 thousand crores rupees will be the worth of the IPO
Motilal Oswal, chairman of Motilal Oswal Financial Services, says LIC’s listing will be the largest in India so far. Its market capitalization can overtake companies like Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, TCS. Based on its current asset under management and business premium, its valuation will be more than Rs 8 lakh crore. The government wants to raise 80 thousand crore rupees from the market through it. That is, about 10 per cent stake will be sold.
LIC’s listing will also affect global markets
They say that listing of LIC could change the weightage of the country’s stock market in a big way in the global equity markets. The government may see the participation of retail investors on a large scale in this IPO. It will issue shares to employees and unitholders. This stock will be at a discount and because of this new investors will come in the market. It is estimated that 200 million new Demat accounts can be opened. It has about 1.25 lakh employees. 32 crores it has a policy. This suggests that at least 40 million retail Demat accounts can grow from its IPO.
Retail can get a share of 25 thousand crores
In the biggest IPO to date, if we look at the Coal India IPO, the retail share in it was 2.1 times. It was an IPO of 15 thousand crores. LIC will raise 80 thousand crore rupees and if it is considered to be 35 per cent retail share, then about 25 to 28 thousand crores will go to retail share. This would be two and a half times the retail portion of Coal India’s IPO.
This financial year will be an attractive IPO
Statistics show that the IPO gave a good return in 2019. This year, all eyes are on the IPO of LIC. LIC is the largest insurance company in the country and also the largest financial institution. LIC has a market share of 75 per cent in terms of policy with assets of Rs 31 lakh crore. It has a 66 per cent stake in First Year Premium. Its net profit is 2.6 lakh crores.
The total investment is 20 lakh crores
LIC is also the largest institutional investor company in the country. Its total investment is 20 lakh crores in the country. Among the life insurance companies listed recently are HDFC Life, SBI Life, ICICI Prudential Life. All three have attracted investors. After listing, LIC will be the most valuable listed company in the country. It will also attract foreign investment."
"Tata Power has already shortlisted seven investors - including Mubadala, KKR, Brookfield, Petronas and Canadian pension fund CDPQ - to negotiate to raise investment in its InvIT Nevin John | August 8, 2020 | Updated 00:33 IST
Tata Power Company Ltd (TPCL), India's oldest power generation company, targets to drastically cut its gross debt, launching infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) in the second half of this financial year. According to the estimates of experts, the company wants to reduce the debt by at least Rs 18,000-20,000 crore on its books through the process.
N Chandrasekaran, chairman, Tata group said at the recent annual general meeting (AGM) that the company will reduce its gross debt to Rs 25,000 crore, which is at Rs 48,376 crore right now. He wants to achieve it through the sale of non-core assets, equity infusion from Tata Sons and formation InvIT and stake sale in it.
Morgan Stanley Research values the 2,630 megawatts (MW) renewables portfolio of TPCL between Rs 18,500 crore and Rs 20,400 crore. However, the green energy business enjoys higher valuation in the stock market because of its low electricity generation and maintenance cost and environmental benefits. Adani Green Energy, which has an operational renewable portfolio of 2,595 MW, is valued Rs 58,000 crore on Indian stock markets.

TCPL plans to transfer its Rs 11,000 crore of debt, which is part of the renewable portfolio, along with the assets to the InvIT. ""The transaction would lead to actual equity release, with part to be used for debt repayment and part for equity needs of under-construction assets,"" the research agency said.
According to news reports, the power major has already shortlisted seven investors - including Mubadala, KKR, Brookfield, Petronas and Canadian pension fund CDPQ - to negotiate to raise investment in its InvIT. The company is expected to dilute its 49 per cent stake in the InvIT in favour of investors and retain the rest.
TPCL plans to increase the share of renewables in EBITDA to 50-60 per cent by FY25 from the present 30 per cent. Chandrasekaran said, ""The company aims to be one of the leading players in renewables. The company will scale both its manufacturing of solar cells and modules as well as the solar EPC business. The company intends to add additional capacity of 10 gigawatts in the next five years.""

Morgan Stanley said in its report that the company is undertaking balance sheet repair. Since April this year, TPCL has sold its stake in Cennergi and shipping business for Rs 2,300 crore. The company targets another Rs 2,100 crore from sales of other non-core assets by March 2021. Moreover, the promoters Tata Sons approved to infuse equity of Rs 2,600 crore in the company.
Chandrasekaran said TCPL will end FY21 with a debt of around Rs 25,000 crore, bringing down the debt to equity ratio to 1 from 1.99 in March. ""This will also move the Net Debt to EBITDA ratio closer to 3, strengthening the balance sheet and lowering financing costs,"" he added.
The consolidated revenue of TPCL decreased by 3.5 per cent to Rs 28,948 crore in 2019-20. The profit before exceptional items stood at Rs 1,231 crore as against Rs 1,274 crore in the previous year. The consolidated net debt at the end of the year was Rs 43,578 crore in March. The major liability on the books of TPCL is its ultra mega power plant in Mundra. The 4,000 MW plant is making losses for years because of the low electricity price realisation. TPCL made an investment of Rs 24,000 crore for building the plant and covering the losses."

Russia is trying to “undermine” presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s candidacy, while China and Iran are against President Donald Trump ‘s reelection, a leading U.S. intelligence official said Friday.
The analysis of the three U.S. adversaries’ alleged interference efforts came in a statement from William Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, who said he released the information to help Americans “play a critical role in safeguarding our election.”
While many foreign actors have views on who should hold the White House, “We are primarily concerned about the ongoing and potential activity by China, Russia, and Iran,” Evanina said.
He warned that “foreign states will continue to use covert and overt influence measures in their attempts to sway U.S. voters’ preferences and perspectives, shift U.S. policies, increase discord in the United States, and undermine the American people’s confidence in our democratic process” ahead of the Nov. 3 election.
“We are all in this together as Americans,” Evanina said in the statement. “Our election should be our own. Foreign efforts to influence or interfere with our elections are a direct threat to the fabric of our democracy.”

The alleged preferences of Russia, China and Iran reflect how Trump and Biden have talked about them on the campaign trail.
Trump in nearly every recent speaking appearance has criticized Beijing for its handling of the coronavirus, which first appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan. His administration has regularly condemned Iran and attacked it with punishing economic sanctions.
Biden, meanwhile, has slammed Trump for failing to address Russian threats abroad.
China wants Trump to lose in part because Beijing sees him as “unpredictable,” Evanina said.
“China has been expanding its influence efforts ahead of November 2020 to shape the policy environment in the United States, pressure political figures it views as opposed to China’s interests, and deflect and counter criticism of China,” it said.
On Russia, U.S. intelligence assesses that the Kremlin “is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia ‘establishment.'” Russian officials are “spreading claims about corruption” to try to “undermine” Biden and the Democratic Party, the statement said.
“Some Kremlin-linked actors are also seeking to boost President Trump’s candidacy on social media and Russian television,” it said.
Evanina’s statement also says that Iran “seeks to undermine U.S. democratic institutions, President Trump, and to divide the country in advance of the 2020 elections.”
Iran is likely focusing on online influence operations, including social-media disinformation campaigns and promulgating anti-American content.
“Tehran’s motivation to conduct such activities is, in part, driven by a perception that President Trump’s reelection would result in a continuation of U.S. pressure on Iran in an effort to foment regime change.”

"MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty President Donald Trump moved on Saturday to enact a payroll-tax cut on his own, circumventing Congress . The idea gained traction in the White House after two conservative economists called on the president to use executive authority to suspend that tax collection and add money to workers' paychecks. But experts say employers are likely to hoard the cash, since the president only has the authority to defer tax collection — not to forgive it. ""Knowing that, employers would be taking an enormous risk if they don't withhold the tax they're legally liable for,"" tax expert Seth Hanlon told Business Insider. President Donald Trump signed an executive action on Saturday to delay the collection of payroll taxes . He has sought to enact an outright cut throughout the pandemic in an effort to juice worker's paychecks.
The text of the memorandum says that people earning under $4,000 every two weeks — or under $104,000 yearly — won't have to pay the tax out of their paychecks from September 1 to December 31.
It may set the stage for a clash with lawmakers from both parties, given Congress dismissed the measure in past stimulus proposals. And many economists say it would not be effective in helping millions of unemployed people. Advertisement But the move is unlikely to deliver more cash into worker's pockets. The memo simply defers payment of the taxes to next year, and only congressional legislation can toss out any legal liabilities. With stimulus negotiations at a standstill, the idea gained traction in the White House after a pair of conservative economists, Stephen Moore and Phil Kerpen, called on Trump in a Wall Street Journal op-ed last weekend to ""declare a national economic emergency."" They said he should order the IRS to stop collecting payroll taxes from employees' paychecks.
""Voters would instantly see the 7.5% boost to their paychecks,"" they wrote. Advertisement Read more: MORGAN STANLEY: The government's recession response has the stock market heading for a massive upheaval. Here's your best strategy to capitalize on the shift.
How the payroll tax works The federal government imposes a 15.3% levy on wages known as the payroll tax. It's evenly divided between employers and workers at 7.65%, and most of it goes to fund Social Security. It also helps to finance Medicare. Trump's memorandum seeks to postpone the 6.2% portion every worker has taken out of their paycheck for Social Security. Advertisement Experts say it's not as straightforward as the conservative economists had laid out. The tax code allows the Treasury Department to postpone tax deadlines for up to a year only during a national disaster , Daniel Hemel, a tax-law professor at the University of Chicago, wrote on Twitter .
""There's no deadline that can be delayed in order to achieve"" the paycheck boost that Moore and Kerpen outlined, Hemel said.
That's because of the executive branch's jurisdiction over taxes. While Trump has the authority to order the IRS to stop collecting those taxes from people's paychecks, the president can't wipe away tax bills on his own; it requires Congress to step in. Advertisement So even with an executive order suspending payroll taxes, companies are still required to make those payments in the future — unless Congress passes legislation letting employers off the hook.

Experts think companies will just hoard the cash instead of turning it over to workers Seth Hanlon, a tax expert at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, told Business Insider it's unlikely that employers would turn that cash over to workers, because of a fear of footing the bill when it's due. Advertisement ""Ultimately, if they don't withhold, they're liable for the employees' share of the tax,"" Hanlon said. ""Knowing that, employers would be taking an enormous risk if they don't withhold the tax they're legally liable for."" An executive action, economists say, could amplify the shortfalls of a payroll-tax cut in combating the pandemic-induced recession.
""The EO would take the negative aspects of a payroll tax cut & exacerbate them: businesses would be unlikely to increase hiring or investment, workers wouldn't see greater take-home pay & the unemployed would still not see a cent,"" Samantha Jacoby, a senior tax legal analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, wrote on Twitter . Advertisement Republican lawmakers don't appear to be as enthusiastic as Trump about a payroll-tax cut through executive action. They left it out of their $1 trillion stimulus plan and included another round of stimulus checks instead .
""The point is, what does the law allow?"" Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chair of the Senate Finance Committee, said on Monday. ""The only tax policy that is really any good is long-term tax policy.""

https://mybs.in/2YPTbmF Buffett, known for swooping in as a lender of last resort in the 2008 financial crisis, remained relatively cautious during the early days of the pandemic ALSO READ Warren Buffett donates $2.9 bn to Gates Foundation, family charities
Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is finally showing a bit more of an appetite. Buffett’s conglomerate began putting more of its $137 billion cash pile to work after a period of relative silence during the start of the pandemic, striking a deal for natural-gas assets in July and even snapping up at least $2 billion of Bank of America stock in recent weeks through August 4.
Now, investors will learn on Saturday whether that appetite extended to the conglomerate’s own stock, as some analysts say buybacks may have risen to a record. Berkshire is expected to report second-quarter earnings that day, results that could show that gains in the stock portfolio drove net income to the highest ever for a company in the S&P 500.
The recent transactions are “a nice start,” said Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones, adding that he hoped the Bank of America stock purchases indicated there was more investment activity by Berkshire. Still, “it’s not a tremendous amount of capital given the size of the balance sheet, size of the investment portfolio and market cap of the company.”
Buffett, known for swooping in as a lender of last resort in the 2008 financial crisis, remained relatively cautious during the early days of the pandemic. The 89-year-old chief executive officer offloaded airline shares in April and failed to find deals similar to his 2008 Goldman Sachs Group and General Electric preferred-stock bets — in part because of the swift action by the Federal Reserve.
That’s left investors wondering whether Buffett’s cautious commentary at his annual meeting in May meant the billionaire investor would stay on the sidelines. Buffett said even Berkshire’s record cash pile at the end of March wasn’t huge when compared with the worst-case scenario for the pandemic and economic shutdown. And he said stock buybacks weren’t more compelling even after Berkshire shares fell 20 per cent in the first quarter.
A regulatory filing that detailed Buffett’s annual gifts to charities gave investors a hint that he may have found the shares more attractive in the months following his annual meeting. UBS Group AG analysts say it indicates that Berkshire bought back $5.3 billion of its stock from April 23 to July 7. A total near that level would surpass Berkshire’s record quarterly repurchases since loosening its buyback policy in 2018.
“One of the biggest frustrations with Berkshire has been its minimal share buyback despite its shares trading at a significant discount to intrinsic value and its massive cash position,” UBS analyst Brian Meredith said July 28 in a note to clients. “BRK’s shares continue to look inexpensive, and we would look favorably on a continuation of large-scale share buybacks.”
What Bloomberg Intelligence says
“Berkshire’s opposition to deploying capital may be thawing somewhat, and we believe share repurchases are a logical option,” stated Matthew Palazola, senior industry analyst, and Derek Han, associate analyst.
Berkshire had to disclose its purchases of Bank of America shares already because it now holds more than a 10 per cent stake in the lender. Saturday’s regulatory filing should give a better indication of how active Berkshire was in the broader stock market during the quarter.
“The first quarter, rightly so, there was certainly a lot of uncertainty,” said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research. “But I also think there is going to be a continued degree of prudence as they see how some of the insurance claims play out.”
Here’s other topics that could come up in the earnings report:
Record Income
Net income is expected to reach a record $37.7 billion, according to estimates from UBS’s analysts. The stock market came roaring back in the second quarter with a nearly 20 per cent gain by the S&P 500. That should help boost Berkshire’s net income, which includes swings in its massive portfolio of stocks.
Apple Inc., Berkshire’s largest common stock holding, gained more than 43 per cent in the second quarter and has continued to surge, bringing its year-to-date increase to roughly 55 per cent through Thursday’s close. Berkshire’s stake would have been worth $89 billion through the end of the second quarter unless it bought or sold shares. That means the Apple holding was equal to 18 per cent of Berkshire’s market capitalization.
Berkshire’s Businesses
Berkshire’s operations, ranging from its railroad BNSF to its footwear and apparel makers, are likely to continue to feel the pain of the pandemic. The conglomerate said that most businesses were hurt in March and April, with the impact ranging from “relatively minor to severe.”
Some units, such as auto insurer Geico, could actually benefit as rivals including Allstate Corp. report fewer vehicle accidents. Still, some of Berkshire’s other insurance operations face the risk of Covid-19 losses, according to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Meyer Shields. The railroad probably saw declining volumes, according to UBS.
“Because of their mix of businesses, they really are a microcosm for the broader economy,” CFRA’s Seifert said. “Over the weekend and over the last week or so, we’ve seen a rash of retail bankruptcies. It’ll be interesting to see if any of the smaller, retail- and consumer-oriented names within Berkshire go that route.”
Charlie Munger, a Berkshire vice chairman and Buffett’s longtime business partner, warned in April of that possibility, saying that a few of Berkshire’s small businesses might not reopen once this situation is over.
“An update on what that does and doesn’t include would also be very helpful,” KBW’s Shields said.
Potential Hits
Berkshire cautioned in its last earnings report that it had weighed taking an impairment for goodwill because of Covid-19 disruptions, but decided it wasn’t necessary. The company warned that the pandemic’s effects could be worse than estimated and require it to book impairment charges before its annual review in the fourth quarter.
Kraft Heinz Co., the packaged-food giant that counts Berkshire as its largest shareholder, posted non-cash impairment charges in the second quarter. Berkshire’s carrying value for its Kraft Heinz stake exceeded the market value by $5.5 billion at the end of March. Buffett’s company has avoided an impairment so far, citing the length of time that the fair value has been less than carrying and a desire to hold the investment until it recovers.
“For the sake of balance-sheet integrity, the value of Kraft Heinz on Berkshire’s balance sheet should not be what it currently is,” CFRA’s Seifert said."

"NSE Tom Lee sees a ‘monstrous rally’ in ‘epicenter stocks’ next week The best start to an August for the U.S. stock market in years might get even better, as soon as next week, if the forecast from Thomas Lee, founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, is accurate. Lee makes the argument that the stock market’s underloved sectors are on the verge of a breakout that could come as his research team sees COVID-19 cases peaking, setting the stage for what he describes as a almost textbook… Read More… Post Views: 0"
"A Polish-Canadian newspaper linked to a community group that’s received almost $300,000 in government funding, twice published an anti-Semitic tirade recently that suggested COVID-19 is a creation of “organized Jewry,” and that Jews were the cause of all the world’s ills. The article has come to light amid warnings worldwide about a unique wave of pandemic-spawned anti-Semitism. B’nai B’rith Canada says it has called on police to investigate the newspaper story as a hate crime, alleging it’s a blatant violation of the law. “To publish something like this in a Canadian newspaper, whether it’s in English or non-English, is criminal. It’s absolutely criminal to pursue this form of hatred,” said Michael Mostyn, CEO of the human-rights group. “We feel very strongly that this is a case where charges should be laid … We know that hate speech provisions of the Criminal Code are not often used, but this does cross the threshold.” The commentary appeared first as the leading front-page article in the March 25 edition of Glos Polski, a weekly newspaper based in Toronto that claims to be read by Poles “around the globe.” Headlined initially “Coronavirus, or fake pandemic,” it ran again in the April 22 edition, both times without a byline. In discussing the origins of COVID-19, the story suggests that “biological weapons are being worked on in the U.S. and Israel not by just any experts, but (under) the leadership of usually Jewish psychopaths.” · Casey Babb on COVID-19: An extra sombre Yom ha-Shoah as anti-Semitism spreads with the coronavirus · Avi Benlolo: The coronavirus pandemic is bringing with it a new level of anti-Semitism It suggests “organized Jewry” can “laugh their heads off” at the COVID-19 crisis, and that Jewish social media had manipulated the world with “Goebbelsian propaganda.” In a rambling discourse, it also suggests the radical Islamist group ISIL was a Jewish creation to reduce the population of gentiles, that Israel is “the cause of all the world’s woes,” Jews want to create a Judeo-Polonia state in Poland and that Jews control the world’s stock markets. It said Vladimir Lenin, Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels and Turkish strongman Recep Tayyip Erdoğan were all covert Jews. The newspaper’s editor, Wieslaw Magiera, could not be reached for comment by deadline. A promotional page on the polishcanadians.ca website describes the outlet as a “paper which searches for the Truth, protects the good name of Poles and reminds us of the Polish culture and history.” The same page says Glos Polski is “edited by” the Polish National Union of Canada. On its website, the Union itself describes the paper as its “press body” and says the two have been inextricably linked since Glos Polski’s launch in 1951. The Union says it is one of Canada’s largest Polish organizations, formed in part to counter Communist agitation. It has also benefited from Ontario government largesse in recent years. The Union received $146,000 in 2018-19 from the provincial Trillium Foundation to make renovations to a 50-year-old community space, and $130,000 in 2012-2013 to replace a roof on a community centre and buy new energy-efficient kitchen appliances. The association could not be reached for comment. The article seems to be part of an international trend in racism tied to COVID-19. “The ongoing global pandemic has spurred a fast-spreading epidemic of hate speech and disinformation including conspiracy theories with a clear antisemitic motive,” said the UN agency UNESCO in June, after holding a webinar on the topic. “Data from the World Jewish Congress shows that in the first months of the pandemic, there was a 30 per cent increase in antisemitic content on social media.” Mostyn said it is one thing for such hatred to be spread through social media, but worse to see it printed repeatedly in a Canadian newspaper."

"NSE Realty trusts gain investor favour MUMBAI : Blackstone and K Raheja-backed Mindspace Business Parks Reit made a robust debut on the stock markets on Friday, listing at a premium of more than 10% over its initial public offering (IPO) price. The strong demand reflects ample liquidity in the stock markets and low interest rates globally, which has forced investors to seek high-yield options. The IPO, which was priced at ₹275 apiece, was subscribed 13 times. On Friday, shares of Mindspace Reit… Read More… Post Views: 0"
"A rather worrying message came to me from a top market intermediary, who said the content is plausible and the source fairly reliable. It read (I have not corrected or edited the message): An interesting situation seems to have developed. Specifically for NSE Clearing House. Banks seem to be forced to pay Rs 3 cr per Rs100 cr Bank guarantee if they go above NSE’s counter party limits prescribed with each bank. How NSE can do this no one knows. To avoid the concentration of Bank Guarantees now, NSE and some Banks seem to have devised a new method. To provide fixed deposit confirmation from broker to NSE clearing house. It doesn’t require any capital charge for bank because it’s fully backed by FD real money in bank. It also doesn’t add upto BG exposure of bank to NSE. I have been told (subject to verification) that many banks and NSE Clearing House put together have a mechanism where bank gives fixed deposit confirmation to NSE clearing house for say Rs 100 crores on behalf of a broker. However, the broker has deposited only Rs 10 crores as FD with bank in reality. Balance 90 crore is only an ‘illusion’ which bank and NSE Clearing house are carrying on. NSE clearing house, in a way is giving 10 times more exposure to the broker than it should have if the real money had been put in by a broker. Does it remind of old Harshadmehta BR (Bankers receipt)? Creating money out of thin air and then taking speculative positions against that in speculative stock markets instruments? In Harshadmehta days it was supposed to be Badla. Now, it is future and options on Nifty. No one knows how much of bank fixed deposit confirmations issued by banks have real money backing it in NSE clearing house. It might be true for bank guarantee too. This message has reached many people, including journalists. I brought it to the attention of the top brass at the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the stock exchanges. While the SEBI chairman did not respond, off-the-record sources in SEBI and the Exchanges said that the market regulator had, indeed, been questioning clearing houses about collateral. The RBI governor, however, seems more determined to check whether dubious collateral poses a major systemic risk. It has sought SEBI’s cooperation in conducting a specific reconciliation exercise of the margins in the form of lien-marked fixed deposit receipts, bank guarantees, ‘unfunded fixed deposits’, etc. As part of the exercise, SEBI has begun to collect information about the extent of lien-marked fixed deposits receipts (FDRs) that have been submitted to stock exchanges and their clearing entities as margin. A report in The Business Line , about the SEBI enquiry referring to fake collateral or ‘non-funded’ fixed deposits being offered as margin, suggests that this is happening across equity and commodity markets. And that clearing corporations (CCs) of stock exchanges, that are primarily responsible for risk management, have been sanctioning trading limits to brokers based on these ‘non-funded’ fixed deposits. In response to our query, a source at the National Stock Exchange (NSE) offered an explanation to justify how the Exchange and CC are protected. He says that the Exchange has ‘net worth based criteria’ for how much of bank guarantees (BGs) any bank can issue to its CC. We are told that “post an initial free limit, further limits up to a maximum threshold, based on net worth of the bank, are given against a security deposit by the bank. As far as FDs are concerned, the exchange has received lien-marked FD receipts (FDRs) on behalf of clearing members from banks, along with a confirmation of an effective lien and that there are no other encumbrances. The arrangements that a bank may have with a broker are not visible to the clearing corporation at all.” Our NSE source seems to suggest that their fake or funded FDRs are within a manageable limit, since it imposes net worth-based limits on the extent of guarantees that a bank itself can issue. However, market sources vehemently disagree. They say, only bank guarantees have limits (there is also a charge on the bank’s capital on issue of bank guarantees or letters of credit), but there is no charge of limit on FDs that can be opened with a bank, because it donotes a cash deposit. We asked NSE for a response to this and have yet to hear from the Exchange. This also means that the NSE and the CC would have no idea if the bank makes a false claim that the FDR was ‘without encumbrance’. In practice, the bank could have extended a loan to the broker which is held as a fixed deposit with the bank (so the principal is safe) and only the interest differential to be paid by the broker is at risk. This subterfuge gives the broker great leverage to trade in the futures market. Whether NSE’s risk-containment criteria are adequate will be known only when the music stops and there is a payment issue. Even here, isolated blow-ups can be contained but is it good enough when there is a massive market movements? How big is the probability of systemic risk? Does anyone know? What happens when the bank refuses to pay and drags matters into expensive and long-drawn litigation? At the moment, one case of a fake or ‘funded’ FDR has already blown up with a brokerage firm closing operations. On 2nd April, IndiaNivesh, a 14-year old firm, suddenly announced a voluntary shutdown of its broking, commodity and portfolio management businesses, citing a ‘liquidity crunch’ caused by the fall in stock markets immediately after the COVID-related lock-down. IndiaNivesh, when it closed shop in early April, had issued a statement to say, “During all this turmoil, there has been mark-to-market losses which have been funded by Edelweiss Custodial Services Limited and Edelweiss Custodial Services Limited was covered with STL, which was available for the credit balances of the clients.” It also asked for all its collaterals and guarantees to be frozen. But this was clearly not true as the matter is now in court. Although the CC has reportedly settled a majority of investor claims ( Economic Times – ET —says 95%), the case filed by Edelweiss indicates that there is a serious problem with the security offered by IndiaNivesh. On 29th April, Edelweiss Custodial Services Limited filed a case in the Bombay High Court to claim outstanding dues by IndiaNivesh Securities Private Limited. HDFC Bank is understood to have issued ‘funded’ FDRs as collateral offered by IndiaNivesh and has refused to pay. The matter is now under arbitration. HDFC Bank’s refusal to pay suggests that things are even more complicated and the role of all parties may be suspect. What is the extent of the hole? The claim by Edelweiss Custodial Services Limited on IndiaNivesh may be to the tune of Rs100 crore says a report by financeintellect.com. Is this the only brokerage firm in serious trouble and caught up in the fake FDR issue? We don’t know. While the market regulator has strictly enforced disclosure rules for listed companies and market intermediaries, the same does not seem to apply to SEBI itself or even the NSE and its clearing corporation. Media reports indicate that SEBI is aware of the problem and has been quietly trying to correct it by asking stock exchanges not to accept ‘funded’ FDRs. According to ET, a SEBI communication to the Exchanges has said, “trading members are showing the full amount of funded fixed deposits (broker deposited plus bank funded) as collateral in their enhanced supervision reporting to the Exchanges.” The term ‘funded FDRs’ itself puts a bland spin on what is essentially a fraudulent activity in showing a loan as a deposit in order to get enhanced leverage for speculative trading. Hopefully, RBI will ensure a full investigation, if nothing else, to ensure that it is not caught napping like it was in 1992, when the issue of fake banking receipts (BRs) to back ready-forward transactions of banks and financial institutions formed a big component of the securities scam. No governor would want that under his watch, nor should Ajay Tyagi, who is all set to take fresh guard for another 18 months in SEBI. Like this story? Get our top stories by email. SUBSCRIBE "
"Manish Chokhani, Director of Enam Holdings, in a recent interview said he fears the ‘Japanification of the world where there is no real growth’. Once not too long ago most countries wished to be like Japan as the country quickly turned around its economic fortunes with technology and development. So much so that Japanification was a matter of pride for most countries. Not anymore. Japanification has come to mean a country which has been suffering from all kinds of stagnation: political, demographic and economic. How did this unwanted transition happen, and that too so quickly? Japan was totally devastated during World War II and no one imagined that Japan would be the talking point of world economy in next few decades. In quick time, Japanese companies and their products captured the imagination of one and all. Whether it was automobiles where we had names such as Toyota, Honda, Suzuki etc. or household goods where names were Sony, Casio etc….and who can forget the Bullet trains? ‘Made in Japan’ became a top brand by itself and a sign of top quality. There has been fair bit of research trying to understand the Japanese growth and the factors are as diverse as it can get: Industrial policy, undervalued exchange rate, exposure to foreign competition, role of government, importance of technology and so on. Japan’s per capita GDP in 1960 was around $8,600, one-third of the United States per capita GDP. By 1988, Japanese per capital GDP had touched $ 35,000 levels surpassing the US. In the period, average per capita growth in Japan was 5.2 percent, double that of the US. Apart from GDP, all other indicators of development surged, and Japan became a developed country which so far was a club of European economies and the US. The Japanese economic model became an inspiration for other Asian economies and economies such as South Korea and China also used variants of the Japanese models. The Japanese fairy tale ended in 1989 starting with a stock market crash followed by crisis in banks and non-banks, and collapse of the overall economy. In 1998, the US economy overtook Japan in terms of per capita income and continued to widen the gap. The US per capita income in 2018 was $55,000 compared to the $49,000 of Japan. Japan’s average per capita GDP growth rate in period 1998-2018 has been 0.76 percent, half of the US average in the same period. How times turned around! Just like the Japanese surge surprised all, the stagnation has been equally vexing. Macroeconomists pointed out how Japanese policymakers did not address the declining economy with alacrity and delayed fiscal and monetary stimulus. More importantly, they delayed responses towards the financial sector and research shows that a financial crisis delays and prolongs an economic crisis. This was one of the central lesson from the Great Depression as well where large-scale banking failures in the US made the depression a prolonged affair. Japanese demographics too turned adverse as the country has been increasingly having a higher share of aged people compared to younger ones. Since then, Japanese policymakers have struggled to put the economy back on track. There have been several attempts but the economy remains mired in deflation and low-growth conditions. The term lost decade became synonymous with Japan, and by 2019 we had three such lost decades. The term began to be used for other economies which let go of opportunities, and had lower-than-expected growth. For instance, Puja Mehra recently wrote a book on Indian economy titled The Lost Decade (2008-18). As the 2008 crisis struck, one problem facing developed countries was to avoid another Great Depression. They managed to avoid the Great Depression but it soon struck that they could resemble Japan. In 2013, American economist Lawrence Summers spoke on how the developed world could be stuck in secular stagnation with low growth rates and little hope for revival of growth rates. Summers obviously mentioned Japan in the speech for its lower growth rates. Summers added the policymakers should take advantage of the low interest rates and push for investment to get out of the stagnation. In a February interview, European Central Bank (ECB) chief economist Philip Lane was asked a question on whether there will be Japanification of the Eurozone economy? He said that recent ECB policies such as resuming quantitative easing and negative interest rates are an attempt to ensure there is no Japanification of Eurozone economies. These policies are an attempt to bring inflation to positive zone, unlike Japan which has struggled with low deflation for a long time now. As economists and policymakers think and act on preventing the Japanification of their economies, one cannot help but think how quickly Japanification has become a word of good riddance for economics rather than good acceptance as was the case earlier. How did Japan’s story become like that of a business organisation which rises to stirring heights only to decline and remain stagnant thereafter? American and European economists have for long lectured Japanese on getting rid of their long crisis. Japanese policymakers have grappled with their suggestions and even tried their own. Their response is that that best way to avoid a Japanese style economic crisis is to make sure the crisis does not happen at the first place. Americans and Europeans (and even Asians) are now learning the taste of Japanese medicine. All is not lost for Japan though, and they have plenty to offer the world. Their sanitation and mask-wearing habits are lessons for countries. In a recent research, Hirotaka Takeuchi of Harvard Business School pointed how Japanese companies are so good at surviving crises. They plan for 100-200 years knowing there will be crises and we need to fight the same. This approach is needed by the businesses across the world which are grappling with the current pandemic.

"Vijay Chandok The current COVID-19 induced situation facing the global economy is a black swan event with dislocation across the globe at a scale never seen before. In times of crisis, the human body’s natural response is to protect itself by increasing its own capabilities. It is true for mankind as well. Big bang reforms in the history of mankind have been in reaction to a major crisis. For instance, the American civil war resulted in the end of slavery, World War II resulted in the creation of peacekeeping institutions like the United Nations, the global financial crisis has led to tighter banking regulations etc. Closer home, too, each time there is a major crisis, there has been a compelling response from the system. Food shortage during the early decades of independence led to the green revolution, improving farm productivity. The 1992 stock market scam gave birth to electronic trading. The balance of payment crisis in 1991 led to liberalization of the Indian economy. These big bang moves short-circuited years of meandering and incremental change. The current Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign launched by the government is similar to the body attempting to strengthen itself to face the current and future challenges in a more resilient manner. Measures like support to MSMEs, permitting commercial mining, Agri reforms, etc. all lead to a larger goal of self-strengthening, self-reliance, and sustenance. In line with this objective, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has come out with a slew of policy measures to strengthen the capital market, a critical component of the Indian economy. SEBI – A Proactive Regulator As soon as the realities of the ‘new normal’ set in early March this year, there was a tremendous amount of uncertainty in the capital markets. Many capital raising and M&amp;amp;A options being assessed suddenly seemed unviable. The swiftness with which this happened, did not give enough time to anybody to figure out the best course of action. The response of SEBI to this uncertainty has been remarkable. The number of COVID-19 related measures that were and are still getting rolled out are not only prompt but sure to have a far-reaching impact on the capital market and more importantly for Indian Inc. The early measures taken by SEBI include the extension of SEBI card’s validity period for IPO candidates. This means that the time lost by the issuers to launch a transaction during the pandemic will be discounted, bringing relief to issuers who have incurred cost and time in coming to this stage. The other concurrent relaxation is the flexibility to change the primary issue size by 50% (from earlier 20%) so issuers can adjust the issue size commensurate to a possibly attenuated demand and yet go on with the fund raise. It has become tough for companies to find capital to sustain and fuel their growth. To alleviate this, it is imperative for freely priced products to be available for the issuer to use. Rights Issuances are very well suited to such circumstances as they provide an equal opportunity and option for all shareholders to take part and avoid dilution of stake. SEBI has relaxed the eligibility conditions for issuers to take a fast track route for the rights issue. This has even made newly listed companies (18 months track record required as opposed to earlier 36 months) eligible. There are other relaxations in certain disclosure requirements but one of the most important changes is the relaxation of the minimum subscription threshold for the success of an issue to 75% from the earlier 90%. This is a very pragmatic move considering that there could be a potentially subdued demand yet the issuer can close the issue and use the funds. Relaxations have also been given to listed entities in their continuous listing obligations. For example, the extension of timelines for publication of accounts will help corporates to cope with the issues of limited workforce and data collation and allow them time to get a good assessment of the impact on businesses. SEBI’s advisory on the disclosure of the material impact of COVID-19 pandemic is a sound template to ensure that relevant and sufficient information is flowing from listed entities. SEBI has also allowed companies to raise funds through Qualified Institutions Placement without having a six-month gap between two such events. Issuer receiving good investor reception can raise funds in tranches with a two-week gap. Another important step towards the private placement through the preferential issue is the reduction of the time frame of historical prices that need to be considered to calculate the minimum issuance price. Amendments have been introduced to relax the conditions of companies wanting to come out with further public offerings under the fast track route. It could prove vital not only for the corporates in need of capital but also the revival of the FPO which have been scarce in recent times. On the consolidation side as well, SEBI has stepped up to support the fund infusion in companies by the promoters. The increase in the creeping acquisition limit through a preferential allotment to the promoter is going to ensure that a meaningful amount of capital can be made available to ailing businesses. Another change in the takeover regulations is the allowance to do a voluntary takeover by a holder holding over 25% stake, even if they have acquired shares in the last year. Earlier any acquisition of shares of the target in the past year was a disqualifier to make a voluntary open offer. This will give an opportunity for potential M&amp;amp;A which, in such circumstances, could be critical for the survival of certain companies. SEBI has taken proactive and numerous laudable measures to tame market volatility and ease the compliance burden on various registered intermediaries like a revision of market-wide position limit, increase in margins, extension in the penal provision, and extension of timelines for various regulatory filings. These measures unburden SEBI regulated intermediaries with appropriate controls and at the same time ensure the protection of investors and foster an orderly development of the market. Shoots of Resurgence in the Capital Markets With the bulwark of cogent and relevant countermeasure from SEBI, the Indian Capital markets are well placed to weather storms. The market witnessed a few large capital market transactions which are important to instil faith back in the investor community. While currently, the ability to raise capital has been much better for blue-chip names given the preference of investors to back less riskier names, a few of the corporates are trying to estimate the extent of impact before getting into capital raise mode. As the capital raising scenario evolves along with the COVID-19 situation, there would emerge various other rationales for raising capital such as confidence capital and acquisition capital across equity and even some debt for those who might not have thought of leveraging. Amongst primary market products, as stated above, Rights Issues have been the dominant choice for capital raising in such uncertain times given the ability to freely price the equity as well as protect dilution of existing shareholders while ensuring adequate capital is raised further bolstering the balance sheet of the Company. In addition, the ability to tailor various instruments such as a partly paid-up share or a compulsorily convertible debenture or an issue of NCD + warrants allows staggered fundraising, easing out investor liquidity issues as well as securing financing. The provision of fast track, as well as reduced disclosure norms for eligible companies, have also cut the time to market for such issues. There is enough and more appetite for high-quality names at the right price and as the market infrastructure opens up, which should happen in the coming months, the activities in Indian Capital markets is bound to shore up. Going Forward: Going forward, SEBI may consider encouraging the NRI remittance to further strengthen our economy. This is a source of patriot money which can help tremendously government’s Atmanirbhar ambition. NRI remittances are categorized as Natural and Induced. Millions of Indians working abroad and sending money home to their families constitute natural remittance and this source is under some pressure now due to lower economic activities globally. However, there is a large untapped Induced remittance, which is business investments by the rich NRIs. This is potentially a very large pool, given the number of affluent Indians abroad, and is solely dependent on how well we frame policies on ease of doing business and welcoming such capital. SEBI may consider some below measures to encourage this all-season capital. Many NRIs desirous of investing in the Indian capital markets are constrained by some of the “pre-COVID” era requirements of documentation and procedures, which many find cumbersome. SEBI’s recent guidelines on seamless and paperless customer on-boarding procedure has played a big role in record retail participation in the capital market. Similar investor-friendly policy interventions could also be replicated for the NRIs. While NRIs can participate with other categories of investors, the regulator could consider earmarking a portion of the public issue for them. This could encourage the flow of a new pool of capital. SEBI may consider forming a task force to identify the pain points faced by the NRIs and recommend suitable resolution measures. In addition, the activity in capital markets can be supported further with certain other steps such as increasing the maximum permissible discount to the SEBI floor price (currently 5%) in case of qualified institutions placements. For rights issues, companies listed through the scheme of arrangement/change in control can have reduced disclosure v/s full disclosure offer document which could significantly reduce their launch time. Another critical issue is that while the extension has been granted to the IPO card validity, the information in the filed DRHPs is quite dated. SEBI may consider giving a relaxation allowing an addendum to the DRHP for critical updates on the business, industry, financial, etc. This will immensely help the issuers to not only demonstrate the COVID impact on their businesses but also help them market their issues with updated information allowing investors to make a well-informed investment decision.

"Bangladesh security agencies at the weekend say they have found details of a top secret meeting at an corporate guest attended by some military and intelligence officers trying to plot the removal of BD army chief General Aziz Ahmed.
This meeting presided over by a pro-Pakistani adviser to PM , says BD intelligence officials, have “sinister connotations”.
Some of those in the meeting are aspirants for the top job, others of anti-Awami League dispensation.
After a regime change plot by a ‘Major Power’ which had this ‘pro-Pakistani adviser’ leading the machinations with his son , Bangladesh agencies foiled the plot , partly by sheer luck when a retired military participant spilled the beans to a leading intelligence agency in the country by meeting its officer in Bangladesh embassy in Washington .
Then the agency arm-twisted another participant from a smaller anti -AL party and got him to confess.
Now the DIG (Confidential) of Bangladesh police has asked Bangladesh Deputy High Comission in Kolkata to find out the place of stay of some of the conspirators who came to the city to meet diplomats of a ‘Major Power’ in February for the first two meetings.
All subsequent meetings were held online in virtual mode.
The letter asks the mission to check on places of stay of the conspirators, the fact of their travel being already confirmed from airport immigration records.
The ‘pro-Pakistani adviser’ has unleashed a major insinuation campaign against senior BBC journalist Subir Bhaumik after the expose of his evil empire built on more than $800 million bank default and more than 50000 crore Taka in money laundering.
The secret meeting on Friday night took place in the corporate guest house of this ‘pro-Pakistani adviser’ for firming up a plan to oust Aziz, who is otherwise in control of the army.
“This small gang of generals and brigadiers are enmeshed with the pro-Pak adviser and they see Aziz as a major bulwark against their evil plans because the army chief is totally loyal to PM Sheikh Hasina,” said a top Bangladesh intelligence source.
A recent trend of getting key military appointments initiated by PMO, which leaves Army Hqs no choice, has seen the removal of key aides of Gen Aziz from crucial positions.
The removal of Brig Salam from the position of DMI is one of the many such appointments orchestrated by this pro-Pakistan adviser.
There is confirmation of the meeting from other diplomatic sources in Dhaka — it is open secret most big missions have intelligence officers under consular cover.
The meeting resolved to (a) mount maximum pressure on PM Hasina to remove General Aziz (b) appoint one Lt-Gen from their cabal and another to a post like Indian-style CDS (c) mount maximum pressure to take the ‘pro-Pakistani adviser’ into the cabinet and give him Defence portfolio so far handled by PM Hasina herself (d) ultimately project this ‘pro-Pakistani adviser’ as PM and push Hasina to Presidency where she would just be titular head .
It is reliably learnt that this ‘pro-Pakistani adviser’, a Rasputin type character with strong fundamentalist and global jihadi connections (a high level level enquiry has been started by Bangladesh on tip-off from India about terror financing by big corporates), has engineered squabbles in the PM household by playing on different personalities there to trigger a succession question.
India is firm on backing PM Sheikh Hasina to the hilt , despite confusing reports engineered by this ‘Rasputin’ backed Media.
“We have no reason to see her go because she has done so much for us . It is actually payback time and we are considering some major concessions to Bangladesh, from water to world affairs issues. We intend to push for an amicable repatriation of Rohingyas, maybe after the Myanmar polls in November,” said a top Indian foreign ministry source.
The source said India is ‘hardly bothered’ with an occasional videocon between Pakistan PM Imran Khan and Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina —
“Yes we don’t like Kashmir raised, but Pakistan will raise Kashmir even in Covid related meetings or if there is a conference on Mars and Moon,” the source said.
Bangladesh agencies complain that this ‘pro-Pakistani adviser’ has forced them to avoid ‘hard questioning ‘ of detained retired Lt General Sarwardy who was pulled up for his insidious social media interview by Kanak Sarwar . Such social media output were seen as key to a regime change in Bangladesh by igniting huge popular unrest on pattern of the Orange Revolution in Ukraine.
This adviser has also blocked attempts by agencies to interrogate him and his son for involvement in the alleged regime change plot by a ‘Major Power’.
Bangladesh intelligence officials told that they were still awaiting clear instructions on a few important people who were allegedly linked to it.
“We want to interrogate a few bigshots but they are powerful and are obviously active to thwart investigations, even influence them. We know that a PM adviser who managed to quash court cases on his involvement in both 1996 and 2010-11 stock market scams,” said a top official in one of the agencies.
He said the adviser has been barred from PMO and is under surveillance but it was not yet clear whether he can be questioned, as direction on that is awaited at the highest level.
India has watched with unease this adviser’s rise in the Bangladesh PMO and his ability to place his own people at many key positions has been amazing.
Intelligence has details about this adviser’s house in Saudi Arabia which he shared with his in-law who is a BNP leader and businessman, which had become the key staging point for the purported regime change plot.
It is in this house not far from the holy sites that this adviser and his cohorts confabulated with the ‘operations’ cadre of a ‘Major Power’ and later with ISI officials from Pakistan.
The ISI biggest station for operations against India and Bangladesh is located in Dubai, both the legal and illegal residencies meaning those ISI operatives using diplomatic cover and those with cover assignments.
The ISI team in Dubai includes an officer who has studied with the son of the Bangladesh PM Adviser in Karachi – one who is a periodic visitor to Bangladesh under business cover.
The Adviser has outwitted the Bangladesh Foreign Office by convincing the highest decision making authority that China (by its clout on Myanmar government) and Pakistan (by its control over ARSA and other jihadi elements) held the key to Bangladesh’s Rohingya problem and that India had no real role to play in it.
“The BJP’s meaningless rhetoric like calling Bangladeshis termites and India’s less-than-competent diplomatic team in Dhaka has helped this Adviser boost Pakistani influence in PMO and Bangladesh decision making ,” said long time Bangladesh watcher Sukharanjan Dasgupta, author of ‘Midnight Massacre’ , an account of the coup that killed Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
India is sending a tough diplomat, Vikram Doraiswamy, to replace the current envoy , Reeva Ganguly Das, a master in “gayoka-Nayika” soft diplomacy but at sea in handing fast changing political dynamics where Pakistan and China are making determined attempts to woo Bangladesh.
Top diplomats of Bangladesh and Pakistan have held talks recently to promote bilateral relations under the active initiative of the PM’s adviser.
“Both sides agreed to promote bilateral relations with a forward-looking approach,” Pakistan’s High Commissioner in Dhaka Imran Ahmed Siddiqui said on Anadolu Agency.
Referring to the talks with Bangladeshi Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen on July 1, Siddiqui added: “The two sides briefed each other on the COVID-19 situation in their respective countries and precautionary and preventive measures being taken.”
Siddiqui said: “Pakistan believes there is a huge potential in bilateral economic and commercial cooperation. We must work together to realize this potential with a focus on bringing our respective private sectors closer.”
“We want stronger relations with brotherly Bangladesh in all walks of life. We share common bonds of history, religion and culture,” he added.
The Bangladeshi Foreign Ministry did not issue a statement about the meeting and the story was almost missing in Bangladesh media with only the Turkish Anadolu Agency covering it.
Some media reports suggests that the Bangladesh government has been asked by security agencies to sack or at least suspend the Adviser pending investigations but that may not be possible because he has ‘far too much influence where it matters.”
Respected media outlets in Bangladesh like ‘Daily Star’ and ‘Prothom Alo’ and even the ‘New York Times ‘ had reported that the corporate bigshot used his huge influence in the Awami League to silence the 1996 and 2010-11 stock scams before his influence multiplied several times when he went on to become a MP and a PM adviser with the rank of cabinet minister.
Bangladesh and global media reports had suggested that the corporate bigwig said to be prime accused behind the scams also figures in two secret Bangladesh Bank Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) report, one on Money Laundering and another on Bank Defaults which is eating into the vitals of the nation’s burgeoning economy.
FIU was the brainchild of former Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman whose removal from the position was orchestrated by this shady corporate boss on alleged dereliction of duty when a transfer of millions of dollars meant for BB ended up in Filipino casinos.
Rahman’s subordinates responsible for overseeing such transfers were possibly involved but the BB governor, a highly respected economist whose work on Tagore as a socio-economic thinker is path breaking, was unaware and only took the blame for the fiasco because he stood by the principle of collective responsibility.
Both FIU reports put this powerful business magnate on top of their list — the biggest bank defaulted and the biggest money launderer.
Like Rahman, former Bangladesh finance minister A M A Muhith was also apprehensive of the damage this business magnate was causing to Bangladesh’s economy.
Muhith blocked several files involving his companies – so this business magnate orchestrated Muhith’s removal and replacement by his close confidante , the new finance minister, so that he would never be pulled up for his huge bank defaults and his considerable money laundering.
It is rumoured that this shady business magnate is also involved in helping the money laundering operations of a key member of the PM household, something that is already in the radar of the US Inland Revenue Service. But now that he is part of a ‘regime change plot’ these investigations may wane."

Dear Trader…
Trading in Indian stocks began on the fifth day of the week ahead of the Reserve Bank of India's lending policy review, which is expected to boost the economy in the coming days on the back of positive rains across the country.
The repo rate was not changed during the three-day meeting of the Reserve Bank's monetary policy review. the RBI governor Shaktikant Das said the aggressive stance on monetary policy will continue as long as it is needed. We are working hard to accelerate growth. We try to minimize the impact of corona. In addition, we are also looking at the inflation rate.
On GDP growth, there was a three-quarter decline before FY2019’20.The growth rate will remain negative for the entire financial year. However, no statement has yet been made as to how long it could last. In addition, the RBI governor said that the country's economy is now backing on track after the Corona strike. The rural economy is recovering due to good yields. The repo rate of the Reserve Bank was cut by a total of 1.15%. Last year, after February 2016, the repo rate has been cut by 2.50%.
With regard to the commodity sector, the rise in gold and silver was fueled by the announcement of renewed stimulus in many countries of the world, including the US. Gold has seen new record prices globally and domestically, while silver has also moved closer to an all-time high.
Comex Gold hit a new record high of 2069 dollar in the global market. The United States and other countries are preparing to release new stimulus, which has led to a surge in the supply of paper currency and gold.
MCX Gold is expected to trade positively with support placed at Rs 55500 level and intermediate support at Rs 55300 level, we advised to buy on dips targeting higher resistance at Rs 56300-56500 zone.
Friends, the US government bond yield curve continues to steepen, extending support to the bullion. The talks regarding the new coronavirus relief bill continue, as we head towards the end of week deadline set by the negotiators.
US private payrolls growth slowed sharply in July, pointing to a loss of momentum in the labor market and overall economic recovery as new COVID-19 infections spread across the country, which also hints at a possible weaker non-farm payroll data expected to be released today.
India VIX fell by 1.78 percent to 23.15 levels. Decline in VIX from its recent bounce of 25.69 suggests that the bulls are using any decline as a buying opportunity and the overall trend could remain bullish.
Market trends are volatile but the bulls managed to retain their hold on every deep to buy stock specific. It is critical for the index to sustain above 11303 points in the next trading session to retain positive bias as the breach of said level can attract selling pressure on an intraday basis,
Nifty future need to close above 11303 points for the uptrend to continue. If it happens; it will trigger a rally next week that will take the markets to 11373 to 11404 points. The support continues to remain around 11008 points, which if broken, can slip to 10808.

"COMMENT The factors favouring the Indian currency’s appreciation outweigh the negatives at this juncture
The rupee was quite stable in 2019, ending the year with a loss of 2.6 per cent, but 2020 has been quite eventful for the Indian currency.
The Covid-19 pandemic that has the world in a vice-like grip has had a debilitating effect on all economies, impacting currencies as well.
The rupee was largely stable in the beginning of 2020, moving between 70.5 and 72 against the dollar. This was the range that had shackled the Indian currency in 2019 as well.
Despite the slowing growth last year, the rupee was steady thanks to robust dollar inflows in the form of foreign direct investments (FDI), foreign portfolio flows and higher external corporate borrowings.
But the scales turned dramatically in March this year as financial markets hit the panic button, leading to large-scale selling in all asset classes. Currency markets were also hit in this risk-off trade, with the rupee crashing nearly 9 per cent from the January peak to hit a low of 76.91 in April.
Since then, the domestic unit has gradually recovered and is now hovering around 75, with the year-to-date loss at 5.1 per cent.
Going ahead, the fortunes of the rupee are tied closely with the spread of the pandemic and further stimulus infused by central banks. The impact this has on foreign portfolio flows and the dollar will be the main determinants of the rupee’s trajectory over the next year. Easy monetary policies to the aid
Responding to Covid-19, central banks worldwide have been flooding their respective economies with massive stimulus funds.
For instance, the US Federal Reserve has announced liquidity injection of over $3 trillion so far, European Central Bank has launched stimulus measures amounting to €1.35 trillion ($1.6 trillion), Bank of Japan has committed over 110 trillion yen ($1.03 trillion) and Bank of England has announced asset purchases worth £745 billion ($975 billion).
At least a part of this huge dose of money is likely to find its way to the financial markets.
Empirical data show a strong link between central bank stimulus and stock price movement. This is because the expansionary monetary policy helps contain the damage to the economy, thus helping corporate earnings and stocks. Also, rock-bottom interest rates leads to carry-trades with loans being taken in countries with zero or negative interest rates to invest in riskier assets such as emerging markets.
Being one of the largest emerging economies, this money supply is expected to chase financial assets in India, too. This is already being witnessed in the increased inflows by way of foreign portfolio investments in the recent months, particularly in the equities market.
As incoming dollars are converted to rupees, the demand for the domestic currency gets a boost.
Most of the central banks intend to pursue the stimulus measures as long as it takes; a few central banks have already announced extensions. Going by the Fed’s latest decision to stretch the facilities through December 2020, the monetary infusion is likely to be prolonged at least till mid-2021. Until then, the upward pressure on the rupee backed by foreign flows is likely to continue. Dollar’s decline strengthens rupee
Another factor that rupee-watchers need to track closely is the movement of the dollar. It’s the weakness in the greenback that has been buttressing the rupee in recent months, due to the inverse correlation between the two.
The search for a safe haven drove the dollar higher in March, when the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was labelled a pandemic. As dollar demand surged that month, the dollar index — a measure of the value of the greenback relative to a basket of currencies — rallied sharply and registered a fresh three-year high of 102.99.
But once the magnitude of the pandemic became apparent and the Fed decided to throw the kitchen sink at the economy, the dollar could not hold its ground.
The Fed’s asset purchases and loans at an unprecedented scale impacted the dollar in two ways. On one hand, it resulted in increasing the supply of the dollar, and on the other hand, it improved the risk sentiment, lowering the appetite for safety.
Also, the interest-rate advantage of the dollar over other major currencies such as the euro and the yen have now diminished following the aggressive rate cut by the Fed.
This led to a depreciation in the dollar index — it dwindled by about 10 per cent to 92.5, between March 20 and July 31, 2020.
As the Fed looks set to continue pumping in easy money at least till December 2020, there can be a consistent downward pressure on the USD till the end of the year. Consequently, the dollar index might move towards a five-year low at 88.25. Any extension or expansion of the stimulus measures can also expose the dollar to more downside, thus helping the rupee. Mixed picture on foreign flows
Following a strong 2019, when foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) poured in $19.4 billion (equity and debt combined), FPIs have remained net sellers in 2020 with a net outflow of $13.5 billion till the end of July, thanks to an extensive outflow of $15.9 billion in March alone.
The equities and debt segments were equally hit in March with outflows of $8.35 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively. However, as the Indian stock market recovered and central banks began pumping liquidity into the system, FPIs turned net buyers in Indian equities after March. Their net purchases since April in equities amount to $4.9 billion.
These flows can, however, turn erratic if volatility resurfaces in equity markets.
FPIs remain net sellers in Indian debt, pulling out $5.2 billion since the beginning of April. The reduction of about 155 bps in Indian interest rates since March, coupled with high inflation, seems to have rendered Indian debt unattractive to foreign investors.
Net FDI inflows, a more durable form of foreign capital, was up 40 per cent to $43 billion in FY20. But FY21 can turn out to be tepid because of the Covid-19 onslaught. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) expects global FDI to drop by 40 per cent in 2020 and by 5-10 per cent in 2021, thus impacting FDI flows into India as well. This can negatively impact the rupee as FDI was the major contributor to the rupee’s strength last year.
Flows through external commercial borrowing (ECB) by Indian corporates have also been strong in recent times ever since the RBI announced a framework in January 2019 that broadened the pool of eligible borrowers.
Also, the very low external interest-rate regime helps corporates raise fund at comparatively lower rates.
ECB flows were hit by the pandemic. While the inflows in January-March 2020 was $19.29 billion, it declined to $3.5 billion — a 11-quarter low — in April-June 2020. However, going ahead, as the global interest-rate environment is expected to stay low in the perceivable future, corporates are expected to continue to depend on ECB as a source of fund-raising, and these flows can continue to support the rupee until the spread of borrowing rates across India and other countries narrows. Narrowing trade deficit
India’s current account deficit (CAD) more than halved in FY20 to $24.6 billion as trade deficit narrowed (because imports fell faster than exports) by $22.8 billion to $157.5 billion and invisible receipts increased by $9.8 billion to $132.9 billion. The drop in CAD has helped the rupee stay afloat. Trade deficit continues to narrows even into FY21 — it significantly contracted to $9.1 billion in the first quarter of FY21 against $45.9 billion in the corresponding period last year.
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), world trade volume is projected to de-grow by 11.9 per cent in 2020 and grow by 8 per cent in 2021. Considering this, trade deficit is expected to shrink further, which is conducive for the Indian currency.
Crude oil is the biggest import component of India and therefore its price has an inverse relationship with the rupee. Because of the collapse in the Brent crude price, the import bill tumbled 66 per cent from $9.5 billion in January to $3.2 billion in June. Crude prices declined from $66 a barrel in January to as low as $16 in April before recovering to $45 by July-end. These circumstances played out in favour of the rupee.
Based on a forecast by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), excess production capacity and high inventory levels are expected to limit price increase of crude in 2020. The price can possibly increase in 2021 once inventory levels decrease and demand normalises. The forecast average price of $37.5 in 2020 and $45.7 in 2021 is still considerably low, much to the benefit of the rupee. Robust foreign reserves
Strong dollar inflows on account of record FDI investments, FPI inflows and external borrowing of Indian companies have led to a $59.5-billion increase in forex reserves in FY2019-20.
It has already swelled by $56.8 billion to a record $534.6 billion for the current fiscal, significantly improving India’s position with respect to external obligations.
For instance, the current level of reserves can comfortably cover 13.4 months of imports, and the short-term debt (residual maturity) stands at 49.5 per cent of the total reserves.
These metrics indicate India’s strong reserve position, which is a big plus for the rupee. Also, FX reserves is an effective tool in controlling wild swings in exchange rate. Looking ahead
The IMF has slashed the global growth rate for 2020 and 2021, and forecasts the global trade volume to tumble. Likewise, UNCTAD projects a sharp dip in FDI, which has been the largest contributor of inflows to India. However, it might not be all bad news for the rupee.
While the slowdown can hit exports, low prices of crude oil can help stabilise India’s current account balance. Similarly, the ultra-loose monetary policy and monetary stimulus announced by the central banks can result in more inflows into domestic financial markets in the coming months.
And, though there could be a temporary dip in ECB, the corporates are expected to continue to tap foreign loans as rates are cheaper. The downward pressure on the US dollar is also favourable to the rupee.
However, even with substantial inflows, the RBI might not be willing to let the rupee appreciate, as has been the case in recent times.
The reserve bank seems to be redirecting incoming dollars to foreign exchange reserves, which, as a result, has increased to historic highs.
While doing this, the central bank is able to inject rupee liquidity into the system as well as contain the Indian currency from appreciating sharply so as to maintain competitiveness in the global market.
With increasing reserves, the RBI has enough ammunition at its disposal to contain a potential downside as well.
Therefore, the factors favouring rupee appreciation outweigh the negatives at this juncture. However, the RBI’s actions are likely to limit the upside.
The RBI might want the exchange rate to be stable in a range and that makes us believe that USDINR may trade between 74 and 77 over the next year. Rupee to remain range-bound
After marking an all-time low of 74.48 in October 2018, the rupee gradually recovered and largely traced a sideways path in 2019, ending the year with a loss of 2.6 per cent.
But the bears came haunting the rupee back in March 2020, bolstered by the Covid-19 pandemic. As selling pressure mounted, the rupee depreciated sharply and marked a fresh lifetime low of 76.91 towards April-end. Major trend
Just before the global financial crisis in 2008, the domestic currency witnessed its best performance. Between January 2002 and December 2007, it appreciated by nearly 20 per cent, from 49.1 (its 2002 low) to 39.7 (its 2007 peak).
But the trend reversed and the rupee declined to 52.1 — a fresh lifetime low then — by March 2009, losing 31 per cent from its prior peak. Subsequently, there was a corrective rally.
However, the bears took charge again in 2011 and ever since, the Indian unit has been continuously forming lower lows. Thus, the major bear trend which began in 2008 seems to be continuing as the Indian currency recorded its new low — 76.91 — in April 2020. Dollar index
The dollar index, which ended 2019 on a flat note, has looked more volatile since the beginning of this year. In March, it witnessed a sharp rally and marked a new three-year high of 102.99 on the back of safe-haven demand.
But the trend reversed abruptly as dollar supply increased and the index tumbled to form a fresh two-year low of 92.53 last week.
Going forward, even though there might be corrective rallies, the trend remains bearish, and so the index is likely to head lower to 89. A fall below this level can mount significant selling pressure on the dollar, possibly dragging it to 85. Outlook
Even though the major trend of the rupee is downward against the greenback, over the short to medium term, it can chart a different path. As we can notice, the rupee recently firmed up from its lifetime low and has been tracing a sideways trend.
Going ahead, despite favourable conditions such as a weak dollar, the rupee is likely to stay flat for the next one year, possibly between 74 levels — the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the previous downtrend — and 77.
The Indian currency is likely to align with the major trend in the long term, and can even gradually weaken towards 80."
"A question that engulfs the world at this point of time is, why stock markets are rallying when the economy is in toilets? This is not an outlier case of a single market or a region but across the globe we are seeing this phenomenon. This blog tries to explore the reasons behind it and rationalize this decoupling.
Key Takeaways –
 Equity markets have recouped almost all of the losses incurred in 1H2020
 Among OECD and G7 countries, current unemployment rates are much higher than the long term average – driven by USA
 Forward looking nature of the markets are the primary explanation behind this exuberance
1. The Divorce
In 2020, much of the movement in equity markets was dominated by the pandemic when world indices dropped by 30% as of 23rd March on an average from the beginning of the year (Chart 1). Then till date, the world markets have recouped almost entirely the losses incurred albeit slowly than the rate of the fall. The contributors to the rally were US markets, Asian EMs and to some extent Europe where the extent pandemic containment showed fruitful results. This is the financial sector. Source: Investing.com. Note: Values are normalized to 1st Jan, 2020 = 100.
Turning our attention to the real sector, we see that the monthly unemployment levels are at multiyear highs with exception of European Union, all other regions of the global economy are far above the longterm average (Chart 2). Real GDP levels too, paint a grim picture of the global economy where the forecast is for a record contraction in the growth rates in last 20 years (Chart 3). Source: IMF, Author’s own calculations. Source: IMF. Note: 2020 = IMF Forecast
2. The Probable Causes –
 Markets are forward looking
The basic fact that seats in the heart of the argument is that the markets are forward looking and the economic data points are what has happened in the past. When NSE moves from 9500 to 10000, it means that the market players think that in future, NSE could be at 10000 and attaches a value to it.
While, when GDP is at 5% for say any quarter, it means in that past quarter, GDP growth rate was at 5% – not necessarily a value attachment to the upcoming quarters. So, when the markets bottomed in March, the players discounted and rationalized that the worst is over and expected the markets to bottom out and there will be an upward movement from that point. This brings me to my next point – accommodative monetary and fiscal policy.
 Accommodative Monetary and Fiscal policy
To keep the engine of the economy rolling (or any individual) cash is the primary necessity. With businesses closed, the global banks and govts. arranged and undertook loose policies like lowering interest rates, announcing fiscal packages, direct cash transfers for the affected people etc. In addition, unconventional policies was adopted too like bond purchases that helped businesses to generate cash and access loans assisting them in keeping the ball rolling. These moves injected confidence in the market and since its forward looking, upward movement followed.
 Performance of technology, consumer and healthcare stocks
As the world moved to work from home setup, the technology stocks shot up at record highs. The FAANGZ (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google, Zoom) contributed to record high rally in Nasdaq and contributed the majority in S&P’s rally. Globally FMCG and health stocks performed as expected since daily needs (specially sanitizers and masks) were met by the FMCGs while increasing hope of vaccines and related cures pushed up healthcare stocks.
 Re-openings
As the pandemic raged on, the recoveries were also a comfort zone in most of the countries which led to reopening of the lockdowns. Various points indicate that the economic activities are slowly coming back to pre-pandemic levels which gives comforts to the companies which were shutdown. Also, the reopening has the potential to bring back the employment numbers. Higher production can traction the earnings of the market and hence there remains plenty of reason for the markets to go up further by end of 2020 even when the GDP growth rates remain muted.
 Influx of 1st time investors
This has been another consequence of WFH or SFH when many people are trying their hands on the stock market. Some brokerage platforms added more than million subscribers during lockdown of which most are amateurs and little above amateurs. As money came in, the bulls got a significant lift. So, to conclude, the great divorce is evident and to some extent justified. The primary cause that underpins this decoupling is the forward looking nature of the markets – everything stems from it. This decoupling is not recommended in classic macroeconomic text books where its mostly taught that the economy influences markets. Times have changed, so are the theories and we must try to internalize the fact that the books need a rewrite too.

It also finances purchase of solar products, bicycles, home appliances, consumer durables and safe water and sanitation facilities, among others.
SCNL offers income-generating loan (IGL) products to its clients, based on their repayment ability.

To part finance its future capital requirements (Rs. 89.29 cr.), general corpus funds (Rs. 29.76 cr.), SCNL is coming out with a rights issue of 19982667 equity shares of Rs. 10 each at a fixed price of Rs. 60 per share to mobilize Rs. 119.90 cr. The company is offering rights in the ratio of 48 shares against 125 shares held as on August 05, 2020. Only 25% i.e. Rs. 15 is to be paid on application for the number of shares applied and the balance amount will be payable on one or more subsequent calls as determined by the board at its sole discretion for the residual remaining amount of Rs. 45 per share. Issue opens for subscription on August 12, 2020 and will close on August 26, 2020. Staggered payment scheme augurs well for investors.
Scrip turned ex-right on August 04, 2020 with a close of Rs. 70.75 per share. It’s cum right quote on August 03, 2020 was Rs. 77.85 per share. The scrip last traded at Rs. 72.10 per share (on August 07, 2020). It has marked last 52 week high/low of Rs. 297.32/Rs. 43.06 (as per BSE Web).
SCNL’s current paid up capital of Rs. 52.04 cr. will stand enhanced to Rs. 72.02 cr. post this issue (at fully paid up value).

On the financial performance front, for the last three fiscals, on a consolidated basis SCML has posted total revenue/net profits of Rs.1031.24 cr. / Rs. 74.80 cr. (FY18), Rs. 1445.14 cr. / Rs.201.50 cr. (FY19) and Rs. 1503.43 cr. / Rs. 154.97 cr. (FY20). Despite growth in top line, the company has suffered a setback in bottom lines for the concluded fiscal. As on March 31, 2020, SCML’s book value per share stood at Rs. 264.03.
If we attribute FY20 earnings on post issue fully diluted equity, then asking price is at a P/E of less than 3. Issue is priced at a P/BV of 0.22 based on its NAV of Rs. 264.03 as on March 31, 2020. Thus on both these counts, issue appears attractively priced. With this offer price SCML is looking at a market cap of Rs. 432.12 cr. against its market cap of Rs. 519.2 based on last closing ex-right price of Rs. 72.10 (as on 07.08.2020). CONCLUSION:
Issue appears reasonably priced considering its NAV and P/E ratios. The only concern is promoter’s holding at 30%. Investors may consider investment for long term as MFI (Micro Finance Industry) sector is likely to be on track once again post un-lockdown. (Subscribe for long term).

In the lockdown, the government of India and SEBI included the stock exchange services in the category of essential services. Ashishkumar Chauhan, MD & CEO, Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) has said, “In a way, we had to work during the lockdown period since we had to keep the markets open. So, after the lockdown was announced, we made it public on the twitter itself that we are going to stay open. Chauhan was recently speaking at a BW Dialogue on Leadership organized by BW Businessworld.
Informing about the achievements that the BSE have made during the period, Chauhan said, “In a short span of two months we have become second-largest exchange in India in commodities.” He elaborated, “In June, SEBI gave us approval on option on commodities, which was directly buying options on gold and silver. Now in a short span of two months, we have become the second-largest exchange in India in commodities and the largest exchange in gold options already in India.” Also, Chauhan also shared that the BSE has launched almond futures contract after getting approval from SEBI in June.
Analyzing the overall situation during the lockdown period, Chauhan informed, “We had a lot of newer launches and changed our technology.” Adding to that, he stated that the BSE has undertaken the journey of trading from 400 crore a day to 40 lakh crores a day in 25-26 years. Chauhan says: “Why it has happened is because of the technology.” “Services that were physical are being dematerialized,” Chauhan said.
BSE has been doing a lot of business planning: Business Continuity Planning, Disaster Recovery. “But”, Chauhan shared, “Nobody thought that we had to work from home. So we had to build a new way of working in a short period of time.” Chauhan informed, “We ended up raising 3.25 lakh crores of funds largely in bonds and commercial papers for Indian corporates because there was real need for liquidity in early phases – and BSE came in handy.”
On Disconnect between Dalal Street and Real Street
“There is nothing right and nothing wrong, the trust is somewhere in between,” says Chauhan. He further elaborated, “What does a (stock) market do? The market for a stock is basically the market for long terms assets, which will yield you the profits at the long term. What the stock market does is take all the current information to their calculations and project forward to next years.” That is how the market reacts, Chauhan explained giving the example of COVID pandemic, when new information that they have never heard of.
Taking the discussion further, Chauhan shared his key observations and advice on investing. He says: “You should learn to invest and not trade. Frequent trading is not a good idea.” Chauhan is strongly of the opinion that an investor should invest and not speculate. Chauhan emphasized “You should learn to invest and not trade. Don’t try to time the market – that now the market is going up and now the market is going down – don’t invest in speculation.” “Moving ahead, each business will have to figure out newer ways of doing business, newer products, and newer areas to go into,” Chauhan shared.

"At a time when the economy is under stress and the growth is expected to contract in 2020-21, the rising forex reserves have come as a breather for the economy as it can cover India’s import bill of more than one year. Written by George Mathew , Sandeep Singh , Edited by Explained Desk | Mumbai, New Delhi | Updated: August 8, 2020 7:47:48 pm In ten months, India has added 25 per cent of the reserves it had till September 20, 2019. (Getty Images/File)
Covid-hit India’s foreign exchange reserves jumped by a record $11.9 billion in the week ending July 31 to hit a fresh high of $534.5 billion , making it the fifth largest holder of reserves in the world. During the 10-month period between September 27, 2019 and July 31, 2020, the foreign exchange reserves have swelled by $100 billion.
At a time when the economy is under stress and the growth is expected to contract in 2020-21, the rising forex reserves have come as a breather as it can cover India’s import bill of more than one year. India’s foreign exchange reserves: How has the rise been?
The trend of rising foreign exchange reserves started after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a sharp cut in corporate tax rates on September 20, 2019. While investor sentiments turned weak after the budget announcement in July to impose higher surcharge, the government’s decision to reverse its budget decision relating to higher surcharge impact on FPIs along with a cut in the corporate tax rate in September played a significant role in turning the investors mood and draw them to invest in the Indian economy and markets.
Between September 20, 2019 and July 31, 2020, the reserves have grown by $106 billion and, since the beginning of April, it has grown by $60 billion. So, in ten months India has added 25 per cent of the reserves it had till September 20, 2019. India is now fifth in global ranking behind China ($ 3,298 billion), Japan ($ 1,383 billion), Switzerland ($ 896 billion) and Russia ($ 591 billion). What has led to this rise in forex reserves?
The rise has been in several stages and has been led by different factors over the last ten months. Experts say that the rise in foreign exchange inflows through Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI and has also been supported by decline in import bill over the last 4-5 months on account of dip in crude prices and trade impact following Covid-19 pandemic .

Some of the key factors include:
FPI inflows: While it started with a sharp rise in FPI inflows following the government’s decision in September to cut corporate tax rate. Between April and December 2019, FPIs pumped in a net $15.1 billion, according to the RBI.
Dip in crude oil prices: India’s oil import bill declined as the global spread of coronavirus since February 2020 not only roiled the stock markets but also led to a crash in the Brent crude oil prices. While crude accounts for almost 20 per cent of India’s total import bill, Brent crude oil prices fell to levels of $20 per barrel towards March end, it dropped further and traded between $9 and $20 in April. In January 2020, Brent crude was trading between $60 and $70 per barrel.
Import savings: Lockdown across countries in response to Covid-19 pandemic impacted global trade and has resulted in a sharp dip in import expenditure — electronics, gold and also crude oil prices among others.
FDI inflows: Between September 2019 and March 2020 foreign direct investments stood at $23.88 billion and in April and May it amounted to $5.9 billion. Market experts say that a lot of FDI has also come in June and July too, especially the Rs 1 lakh crore plus investment by global tech giants in Jio Platforms. Thus FDI inflow has been a significant contributor to the rise in foreign exchange reserves.
Dip in gold imports: Gold which was a big import component for India witnessed a sharp decline in the quarter ended June 2020 following the high prices and the lockdown induced by the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the World Gold Council (WGC), gold imports plummeted by 95 per cent to 11.6 tonnes in the quarter as compared to 247.4 tonnes in the same period a year ago due to logistical issues and poor demand. The value of gold transacted during the June quarter fell to Rs 26,600 crore, down by 57 per cent as compared to Rs 62,420 crore a year ago, WGC said.

What does the rising forex reserves mean?
The rising forex reserves give a lot of comfort to the government and the Reserve Bank of India in managing India’s external and internal financial issues at a time when the economic growth is set to contract by 5.8 per cent in 2020-21. It’s a big cushion in the event of any crisis on the economic front and enough to cover the import bill of the country for a year. The rising reserves have also helped the rupee to strengthen against the dollar. The foreign exchange reserves to GDP ratio is around 15 per cent. Reserves will provide a level of confidence to markets that a country can meet its external obligations, demonstrate the backing of domestic currency by external assets, assist the government in meeting its foreign exchange needs and external debt obligations and maintain a reserve for national disasters or emergencies. “Adequate forex reserves should provide room for the RBI to cut rates and support recovery. We estimate that the RBI can sell $50 bn to defend the rupee in case of a speculative attack. Of note, RBI action to support growth should attract FPI equity flows,” says a Bank of America report.
What does the RBI do with the forex reserves?
The Reserve Bank functions as the custodian and manager of forex reserves, and operates within the overall policy framework agreed upon with the government. The RBI allocates the dollars for specific purposes. For example, under the Liberalised Remittances Scheme, individuals are allowed to remit up to $250,000 every year. The RBI uses its forex kitty for the orderly movement of the rupee. It sells the dollar when the rupee weakens and buys the dollar when the rupee strengthens. Of late, the RBI has been buying dollars from the market to shore up the forex reserves. When the RBI mops up dollars, it releases an equal amount in the rupees. This excess liquidity is sterilised through issue of bonds and securities and LAF operations to prevent a rise in inflation."

"Higher turnover in gold, silver futures have aided volumes; new launches can bolster revenues
In April, we recommended to ‘hold’ on MCX (at the price of ₹1,072) when the stock was plummeting in the aftermath of a controversy in the crude oil contract. The exchange settled open positions in crude oil April month futures at a negative price as a WTI (West Texas Intermediate) contract in NYMEX price moved into the red.
Investors in the crude futures contract of MCX ended up making huge losses and resultantly the interest in crude futures on the exchange dropped.
As the crude oil contract is volume churner for MCX, the development had worried investors in the stock. Besides, given that the MCX’s trading platform didn’t have a facility to accept a negative price quote, investors were worried over how traders will continue on the contract if WTI moves into the negative terrain again.
Over the last two months, however, a lot of positive developments, including the sharp rally in the price of gold, have helped the MCX stock gain strong traction, more than recoup its losses and rise to a lifetime high.
At the current market price of ₹1,672, the stock discounts its earnings for FY21 by 37 times.
Its average PE ratio in the last three years on one-year forward earnings was about 24 times.
While high earnings visibility and absence of competition in the bullion and energy futures market make MCX a good investment bet over the long run, pricey valuations may limit the upside in the near term.
Hence, investors can continue to hold the stock. Market corrections, if any, should be an opportunity to accumulate the stock. Positives
In the June 2020 quarter, MCX recorded a 14 per cent drop (y-o-y) in operational income. But since June, volumes have picked up sharply on higher interest in trading in bullion futures. Thus, the September 2020 quarter looks promising.
The main drag on the stock — the absence of a provision for negative price quotation in the software — is not a worry any more.
MCX has modified its software to accept negative price and has done a test run, too. So, there may not be any issue for the exchange to attract traders back to its fold. However, since this is a recent development, one has to wait and watch if volumes come back in crude oil futures or not.
The current average daily turnover in crude oil futures on MCX is ₹3,000 crore. In March — before the fiasco in the crude contract — the average daily turnover in the contract was about ₹11,000 crore. That said, the loss in volumes in the crude contract have been offset by higher turnover in gold and silver futures.
The Covid-19 pandemic has led investors across the globe to invest aggressively in safe havens — gold and silver. Since June, as prices of gold and silver started to climb new peaks, speculative interest in gold and silver futures contracts on commodity bourses have been going up.
The average daily turnover in gold and silver put together is ₹23,000 crore now; in March, it was ₹ 16,000 crore.
There has also been an increase in the number of traded contracts on the exchange.
In July, the overall turnover at the exchange, including trade in metals, bullion, energy and agri contracts, was ₹8.5-lakh crore.
This is sharply higher than that in April when volumes were at ₹2.8-lakh crore.
The medium-term outlook for the stock is positive. The exchange is all set to introduce index futures on metals and bullion. Further, with mutual funds that run gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) also considering buying gold futures with the SEBI’s nod, volumes will rise further. The launch of options in goods in gold mini (100 grams) contract is also expected to add to volumes as it will bring more traders (retail investors) and hedgers to the exchange (with costs relatively lower).
The other positive news is that MCX has entered into an MoU with B2B e-commerce company Mjunction to explore setting up of a coal exchange.
While BSE and NSE have been trying to establish themselves in the commodity derivatives space, there has not been much success. In options in in gold, one has to see if BSE is able to sustain the good volumes that it is seeing. Cost control
MCX’s June quarter performance was marred by a drop in the turnover od crude oil contracts and restricted work timing in April due to the Covid-19 lockdown. (Between March 30 and April 22, the commodity market was functioning only between 9 am and 5 pm. In normal days, it functions till 11.30 pm.)
The revenue from operation in the quarter was ₹73.01 crore, down 14 per cent from the same quarter last year. However, lower employee costs and a drop in other operating expenses, along with an increase in other income, helped the company record a 29 per cent growth in net profit at ₹56 crore. The operating profit margin in the June quarter was 62 per cent versus 53 per cent last year.
In the next few months, as prices of gold and silver remain elevated, margins could be strong for the company. But salaries of employees in the Assistant VP level, which was cut by 10 per cent, once restored from this month, could impact some of the costs savings."
"Stock markets globally have rebounded sharply towards their pre-Covid levels. Technology, pharma and IT have been a big gainers in the Covid situation and tech-heavy exchanges, Nasdaq (US) and Shanghai (China), are at all-time/yearly highs. Many other indices are only a few percentage points away from their respective peaks.
The higher the government support, technology presence and control over the Covid situation, the better has been the market performance.
This strong move in the market has had a lot of support from monetary and fiscal policy. This is not the first time that this has happened. Post Global Financial Crisis ( GFC ), high liquidity infusion had caused markets to trade at a higher valuations. In the US, the market cap-to-GDP ratio has seen a very high inverse correlation to interest rates and a very high correlation to increase in Fed balance sheet.
This time around, many more central banks are increasing their balance sheets compared with GFC period. A sharp increase in balance sheets has been witnessed over the past six months for most central banks.
RBI, the Indian central bank, has also seen a sharp increase in its own balance sheet. Higher liquidity infusion does bring interest rates down. With a reduction in yields, investors have to take a higher risk to generate the same returns as the flow of money into riskier asset classes increases over time. Thus, the risk premium in the market reduces and riskier assets trade higher.
Given the strong increase in size of balance sheets of most central banks during the Covid-19 crisis, I expect the low interest rate scenario to persist and higher valuations to hence sustain. My base case is that markets could trade at significantly higher-than-average valuations till liquidity conditions become benign. This would be reflected in improved market cap-to-GDP ratios/ higher P/E ratios or a higher price to book value ratios vs long period averages. Once the liquidity increase stops and central bank balance sheets start to shrink and interest rates start to increase, overtime we should expect the market return to be lesser than the growth in EPS, thereby correcting the valuations back to average levels.
Hence, while our market cap-to-GDP is now back at average levels and PE is higher than average. We do expect these valuations to sustain. The higher risk premium that was there at the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis has corrected itself on strong liquidity infusion.
As index EPS of FY22 is expected to be significantly higher than FY20 EPS, we do expect the market to discount the same over the next one year and expect to see the indices scale its earlier highs over this period, delivering early teens returns from current levels.
There has been some focus on new investors coming into the market. The percentage of non-institutional volumes has shot up substantially than earlier. Retail investors took the benefit of lower valuations, showed confidence in the India story and came in strongly. This is a positive.
Promoters also took the opportunity to increase their holdings. Usually, higher retail participation is seen as a risk indicator. However, this time around since it has happened at lower valuations, even the more informed promoter groups have increased their holdings; it should be seen as a positive.
Which part of the market would do relatively better?
In the past, a higher liquidity-lower interest rate scenario helped higher quality asset-light consumption businesses more compared with levered capex-oriented businesses in terms of stock market performance. This is counter-intuitive, but was seen very starkly during the 2009-2020 period.
Free cash flow businesses, businesses with cash on books did very well while levered businesses/commodity producing businesses where the underlying commodity prices were volatile, did not do as well. This was in part on account of excess capacity that was built in the prior period.
Excess capacity in most industries persist even today. This may also have been on account of a change in capex preferences; for example away from coal-based thermal power to solar power. The polarisation of the market post GFC has been a global phenomenon. In India, it also had an overlay of corporate governance issues.
We do expect the same trends to continue in this period of higher liquidity. Stronger NBFCs should benefit strongly from a good liquidity and lower interest rate scenario, as they would see margin increases. The advantage that a bank has of a deposit taking franchisee vs an NBFC would be less of a competitive advantage in a scenario of surplus liquidity. We do expect high quality businesses in pharma, IT and telecom sectors to benefit from this trend apart from consumer sectors.
The focus would remain on consumption, and categories where growth of a secular nature can be expected over the next few years. Falling discount rates and secular growth can sustain very high valuations.

Shares of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. were left out of the stock market rally in the second quarter . Warren Buffett clearly thought the disconnect wasn’t warranted.
The famed investor spent a record $5.1 billion buying back Berkshire’s own stock in the second quarter, more than double the amount he’d ever purchased before. That came as he unloaded almost $13 billion of other companies’ shares, including airline stocks and some financials, in what was Buffett’s biggest selling quarter in more than a decade.
Buffett has shown signs of buying appetite in recent weeks, but the second-quarter results show those are a new phenomenon as the Covid-19 pandemic has slammed the economy but failed to put a permanent dent in stock-market valuations. Buffett’s been building up cash this year even as other investors have sought to seize on opportunities amid the turmoil, and the pain Berkshire’s own businesses are feeling may inform his thinking.
“Our operating business groups are preparing for reduced cash flows from reduced revenues and economic activity as a result of Covid-19,” Berkshire said Saturday in a regulatory filing. “We currently believe our liquidity and capital strength, which is extremely strong, to be more than adequate.”
Buffett’s cash pile surged to a record $146.6 billion at the end of June, in part from dumping all of his airline shares in April. He’s been more active lately, striking a deal for natural-gas assets in July and snapping up at least $2 billion of Bank of America Corp. stock in recent weeks through Aug. 4.
Berkshire’s Class A shares, which fell in line with the S&P 500 in the first three months of the year as the pandemic spread in the U.S., fell another 1.7% last quarter while the broader index rallied 20%. Buffett said in early May that repurchases weren’t more compelling than at previous times, but the buybacks in the quarter suggest his thinking shifted.
The company’s stock has rallied in July and August, but still is underperforming in 2020. Berkshire Class A shares were down 7.4% for the year through Friday’s close, compared with the 3.7% gain in the S&P 500.
Berkshire’s operating profit slumped 10% in the second quarter to $5.5 billion. That was driven by a 42% drop in earnings from the conglomerate’s manufacturing, service and retailing businesses.
The company also took $10 billion of impairment charges related to its Precision Castparts unit. Berkshire bought Precision Castparts in 2016 in a transaction valued at $37.2 billion, making it one of Buffett’s biggest deals. Now the maker of jet-engine blades and aircraft structural components is bracing for lean times as Boeing Co. and Airbus SE cut jetliner production and less air travel reduces the need for replacement parts.
That’s forced the aerospace-parts maker to undergo “aggressive restructuring,” with the company cutting its workforce by about 10,000 employees during the first half of 2020.
“We believe the effects of the pandemic on commercial airlines and aircraft manufacturers continues to be particularly severe,” Berkshire said in the filing. “In our judgment, the timing and extent of the recovery in the commercial airline and aerospace industries may be dependent on the development and wide-scale distribution of medicines or vaccines that effectively treat the virus.”
Other key takeaways from the results:
Unrealized gains and losses in Berkshire’s massive stock portfolio count toward the bottom line. So the S&P 500’s rally in the second quarter pushed net income to $26.3 billion.
Insurance underwriting profit more than doubled to $806 million in the period. That was helped by gains at auto insurer Geico as fewer accidents benefited the business. Berkshire warned that Geico might be hurt in the next three quarters by a program that’s giving drivers a credit on their premiums."
"Ace investor Joel Greenblatt says investors should follow a long-term investment strategy in order to be able to invest in above-average companies when they are available at below-average prices.
Quoting Warren Buffett , he says, “Buying a business at a bargain price is great. However, buying a good business at a bargain price is even better.”
This, Greenblatt says, can be achieved by following his Magic Formula , which can help one buy mispriced stocks with top earnings yield and high return on invested capital ( RoIC ).
Greenblatt is an eminent investor and hedge fund manager, who in 1985 started the investment company Gowtham Capital, which is famous for giving an impressive 40 per cent annualised return for over two decades. He authored the bestselling book The Little Book That Beats the Market .
Greenblatt’s says his Magic Formula is a simple and an effective way to make profit in the long run, if one has the required patience.
“To earn high returns on capital even for one year, it's likely that, at least temporarily, there’s something special about that company's business. Otherwise, competition would already have driven down returns on capital to lower levels,” he wrote in The Little Book…
Know business fundamentals before investing Greenblatt says the market can be very unpredictable in the short term. However, the stock market is quite efficient in the long run.
“Stock prices move around wildly over very short periods of time. This does not mean the values of the underlying companies have changed very much during that period. Stock markets act much like a crazy guy named Mr Market. It is Mr Market’s constantly changing emotional state that creates bargain opportunities,” he writes.
Greenblatt says a value investor must understand the underlying business in order to be able to value a stock. Some comparatively simple math related to the business performance and understanding the fundamentals of a business are key steps that need to be followed before investing in a stock.
“Choosing individual stocks without any idea of what you’re looking for is like running through a dynamite factory with a burning match. You may live, but you’re still an idiot,” says he.
The 'Magic Formula' to spot multibaggers
Revealing what prompted him to deduce his Magic Formula for finding valuable investment bets , Greenblatt says he became fascinated by Warren Buffett’s investment philosophy about acquiring fantastic businesses at reasonable prices. He studied Buffett’s letters to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in an attempt to compute two variables: 1) fantastic businesses, and 2) reasonable prices.
After studying the two variables, Greenblatt came up with a two-variable formula, called The Magic Formula.
Evaluate stocks based on earnings yield and return on capital: He says the Magic Formula evaluates stocks and ranks them based on two financial ratios 1) earnings yield, and 2) return on invested capital (ROC). The ROC shows how good a company is (fantastic businesses) and the earnings yield tells you whether the company is available for investment at an attractive price (reasonable prices).
Earnings yield = Ebit (Earnings Before Interest & Taxes + Depreciation – Capex) / Enterprise value (Market Value + Debt – Cash).
Greenblatt says earnings yield reveals how expensive a company is in relation to the earnings it generates. While looking at earnings yield, certain adjustments can be made to its market capitalisation to estimate what it may take to buy the entire company.
The process also caters to penalising firms that have excess debt and rewarding those that have a lot of cash.
Return on capital employed (ROIC) = Ebit (Earnings Before Interest & Taxes + Depreciation – Capex)/ (Net working capital + Net Fixed capital).
Here, ROC is the ratio of the pre-tax operating earnings (Ebit) to tangible capital employed (net working capital + net fixed capital).
Greenblatt says the return on the invested capital shows how efficient a company is in turning investments into profits. This ratio deduces the cash a company generates in relation to the amount of capital tied up in its business.
As the value of ROIC increases, all else being equal, a business can be said to be performing better, as higher the ROIC of a business, the more money an investor is able to earn every year in relation to the money invested in the business.
Greenblatt says he uses the ROIC ratio in place of the other commonly used financial ratios like ROE (return on equity) or ROA (return on assets) because Ebit avoids the distortions due to the differences in tax rates for different companies while making a comparison.
Also, net working capital plus net fixed capital is used in place of fixed assets as it gives a better picture of how much capital is needed to run the business.
Pick winning companies by combining these two factors and rank them
The 'Magic Formula' provides both the ratios equal weightage while selecting companies. The formula ranks all possible firms by Good Company (ROIC) and also by Good Price (earnings yield). Then, each firm’s ROIC and earnings yield ranks are added.
The formula finally gives the best combined rankings of companies that an investor can buy and hold for at least a year. After one year, one should review all the companies and move funds to the new highly-ranked companies using the same formula.
Greenblatt says this approach is simple enough and is especially beneficial for investors who are just starting their careers in investing or the ones who are considering to manage their own equity portfolios.
Be patient: Greenblatt advises investors to remain patient while using this formula for investment, as in individual years, it often may not do well.
He says lack of patience is often the reason why investors fail to implement the Magic Formula properly. He advises investors to remain invested for the long term to see the actual magic of the formula.
“If you’re actually willing to stick with it over several years, through the thick and thin, then it will pay off. If you’re not willing to do that and just let it ride, then this investing concept won’t necessarily work. The toughest thing about investing is that you have to be lazy, must behave and keep yourself out of new trouble, once you’ve set a good plan,"" says he.
Consistency is the key: Greenblatt says consistency is the key to success with this formula and investors should stick with the long-term strategy and not get pushed out of it due to short-term underperformance.
“Over the years, many studies have confirmed that value-oriented strategies beat the market over longer time horizons. Several different measures of value have been shown to work. These strategies include, but are not limited to, selecting stocks based on low ratios of price-to-book value, price to earnings, price to cashflow, price to dividend.
These simple value strategies do not always work. However, measured over longer periods, they do. Though these strategies have been well documented over many years, most individual and professional investors do not have the patience to use them. Apparently, the periods of underperformance makes them difficult, and, for some professionals, impractical to implement,"" says he.
Diversify your portfolio: Greenblatt says the core of a good investment is diversification of investments. ""One should have a diversified portfolio to survive bad times or bad luck, so that skill and good process can have the chance to pay off over the long run,"" he says.
Be an independent thinker: The top money manager insists that it is important for an investor to be an independent thinker and not get into the trap of listening to others when they feel they are right. “There’s a virtuous cycle when people have to defend challenges to their ideas. Any gap in thinking or analysis becomes clear pretty quickly when smart people ask good, logical questions. You can’t be a good value investor without being an independent thinker – you’re seeing valuations that the market is not appreciating. But it’s critical that you understand why the market isn’t seeing the value you do. The back and forth that goes on in the investment process helps you get at that,” says he.

"Ed Yardeni on CNBC. CNBC screengrab Long-time bull Ed Yardeni doesn't think the US economy will recover to pre-pandemic levels before the second half of 2022. He thinks US GDP adjusted for inflation will rise by 15% in Q3 2020, but only by 5% in Q4. He told Business Insider: ""I don't really see the economy returning back to its level at the end of 2019 until maybe the second half of 2022."" While he thinks the S&P 500 could hit 3,500 by year-end, he believes a 15-20% correction lower could happen if stocks continue to rattle higher. Yardeni is less bullish, having predicted a V-shaped recovery and a ""melt-up"" in stocks as recently as last month. Long-time bull Ed Yardeni, who predicted a V-shaped recovery for the US economy as recently as last month, has a very different message now. The world's largest economy won't see growth return to its pre-pandemic levels until the second half of 2022.
The renowned strategist and president of Yardeni Research told Business Insider: ""We're expecting that real GDP in the third quarter will be up something like 15% and then maybe 5% in the fourth quarter.""
Yardeni, who is credited with coining the phrase ""bond vigilantes"" back in the 1980's, said he didn't see the economy returning back to where it was in late 2019 until ""maybe the second half of 2022."" He added: ""It's going to be a long, long haul to get back to normal."" Advertisement ""Initially, it may very well be V-shaped, but there are clearly signs in the high-frequency indicators of the economy that the recovery is slowing. So I'm not sure it is a V, U, W, or any other letter of the alphabet. It's more likely a widely heralded Nike swoosh,"" he added, referring to the sportswear company's iconic "" J-shaped "" logo. This marks a change in stance, as Yardeni was looking for a V-shaped recovery — one in which economic growth falls rapidly, before reaching an abrupt trough and recovering just as sharply thereafter. But he has since revised this to a check-mark-shaped recovery, one in which growth contracts rapidly to hit a trough, but then gradually recovers at a far more moderate pace.
Read more: 'The most extreme valuations in history': A notorious market bear says investors should brace for record-low negative returns over the next 12 years — and warns that today's exuberance implies a 66% plunge Advertisement US GDP contracted by a record-breaking 33% year-on-year in the second quarter , suggesting that a V-shaped recovery might well be impossible.
After a stomach-lurching drop in March, when the economic impact of the coronavirus became apparent, US blue-chip stocks have since recovered. A combination of better economic data and more investor confidence in the resilience of the corporate world have since seen Wall Street return, not just to its pre-pandemic levels, but even to record highs, as the Nasdaq has done. Advertisement ""If the market consolidates here, then I'm not going to be too worried about a correction,"" Yardeni said. ""If the market can continue to move higher and makes new record highs, which it very easily could, I'd be inclined to take some profits and anticipate a correction of 15 to 20%,"" he added.
Yardeni already foresaw the swift rebound in the stock market, warning last month of a ""melt-up"" in stocks.
He said at the time: ""I think the bull market is still intact. I don't view the sell-off we had in February and March as a bear market.""

The S&P 500 fell by more than 12% in March, its biggest one-month drop since the depths of the financial crisis of 2008, when investment bank Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy. Since then, it has risen by more than 50%, led predominantly by tech stocks.
Yardeni says if stocks move up further, which they very well could, he would start to look for a correction of around 15-20% in stocks. The ""Cold War"" between China and the US is only one factor that might contribute to a steeper correction. Advertisement Tensions have flared up yet again between China and the US in recent weeks. The most recent diplomatic row flared up when the US government closed the Chinese consulate in Houston and China subsequently ordered the closure of the US consulate in Chengdu late last month. Yardeni expects the S&P 500 to hit 3,500 by year-end, up from around 3,350 right now and well above the existing record at 3,393.5. A 15-20% correction from the 3,500 level would bring the index back to where it was in May.

"Yuqing Liu/Business Insider At the end of July, the extra $600 weekly unemployment insurance benefit established by the CARES Act in March expired, immediately slashing pay for millions of out-of-work Americans. The benefit not only supported those out of work due to the coronavirus crisis, but powered the early months of the economic recovery from the pandemic recession, economists say. Now, Congress is fighting over the next round of stimulus. In the meantime, millions of Americans are wondering how they'll make ends meet. When the additional $600 weekly unemployment benefit expired at the end of July, Charissa Ward, a furloughed Disney server in Florida, knew she wouldn't be able to cover all of her expenses.
Now, she will receive only the Florida state benefit, a maximum of $275 per week before taxes and among the lowest in America. Ward has been out of work since mid-March, officially on furlough since April, and doesn't know when she'll be able to go back.
The $275 per week ""doesn't pay anything really. I can't even cover my mortgage payment, let alone food, my car payment, my insurance, basic electric, you know, nothing,"" the mother of three told Business Insider. ""We're not talking about going on vacation here, we're talking about survival."" Advertisement Ward is among the 31 million Americans relying on unemployment benefits, a safety net that is getting thinner now that the federal government doesn't provide any additional money. The typical jobless person is set to receive around $330 each week, an amount varying greatly across the country. In March, Congress scrambled to design and pass a relief package as sweeping shelter-in-place orders shuttered businesses across the US, kept people at home, and led to millions of Americans losing their jobs . Among its provisions: a $600 weekly federal supplement to state unemployment checks, meant to fully replace the lost earnings of laid-off workers.
Read more: MORGAN STANLEY: The government's recession response has the stock market heading for a massive upheaval. Here's your best strategy to capitalize on the shift. Advertisement That government payout played an enormous role in rescuing a pandemic-stricken economy from collapse. Experts credit the benefit with backstopping income loss and boosting consumer spending in a recession, along with providing people enough money to buy groceries and pay rent and other monthly bills. Some said it helped keep poverty from rising.
""It is so clear from the data we have in hand and from the research that's being done, that $600 [helped] prop up the entire economy,"" Claudia Sahm, the director of macroeconomic policy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, recently told Business Insider. The signs of a recovery Proof that the extra $600 propped up the economy appeared in a number of economic indicators. In April, US consumer spending slumped, but incomes increased by a record 10.5% due to payments under the CARES Act. A month later, US consumer spending spiked a record 8.2% as people rushed to spend their stimulus and unemployment checks. Advertisement In addition, retail spending was strong in May, when it jumped a record 17.7%. That strength continued in June, when retail sales increased 7.5%.
That continued strength is ""a good sign that emergency unemployment insurance bore a lot of the responsibility for those numbers,"" Ernie Tedeschi, an economist at Evercore ISI, told Business Insider.
There's also evidence in high-frequency data that suggests the additional UI benefit lifted consumer spending and the US economy. Data from the Harvard-based research group Opportunity Insights shows that spending for low-income households has nearly recovered to pre-pandemic levels, down only 2% from February. Advertisement On the flip side, high-income spending is still down 10% from before the pandemic.
""Consumption among low-income households has been so strong despite the fact that low-income households have been disproportionately hit by the pandemic,"" Tedeschi said, adding that ""there's circumstantial evidence that our emergency unemployment insurance benefits have done their job to solidify the ground under unemployed workers.""
Read more: 'The most extreme valuations in history': A notorious market bear says investors should brace for record-low negative returns over the next 12 years — and warns that today's exuberance implies a 66% plunge Advertisement That spending is important to the overall economic recovery as consumption is roughly 70% of US gross domestic product. Consumer spending also gives strength to the labor market — when people shop, businesses profit more, and in turn, can expand and hire additional workers. ""So much of our economy not falling 60% and falling 33% in the last quarter was this additional infusion into household incomes from the government,"" Daniel Alpert, Cornell Law School senior fellow and adjunct professor, told Business Insider. A lack of continued support will ""deepen the severity and extend the duration of this crisis,"" he said.
The fierce political clash over $600 Republicans and Democrats hold dueling views of the federal benefit's economic effects. Shortly after it was implemented, many GOP lawmakers opposed its renewal past the summer. In late May, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly pledged to scrap it. Advertisement The GOP is instead pushing to cut the benefit to a lower weekly amount. Many conservatives argued that since the bulked-up payment allowed many workers to earn more from the government than their past jobs, it incentivized them to stay out of the workforce.
""There were definitely businesses that faced hurdles getting their workers to come back. In the longer-term, you never want to be incentivizing people to not work,"" Rachel Greszler, an economics expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told Business Insider. She said extending the $600 benefit would have ""damaging effects in the longer-term"" on employment levels. Advertisement Democrats are pushing to revive the payments through January, saying the economy remains weak due to the ongoing pandemic and jobs are scarce. There are currently five unemployed people for every job opening.
""We're seeing spikes all over the country, unemployment in many places,"" Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, a supporter of the $600 extension, told Business Insider in late July. ""It's so bad, companies are laying workers off again.""
Read more: 100 deals and $1 million in profit a year: Here's how Mike Simmons made a simple change to his real-estate investing strategy that took him from small-time house flipper to full-fledged mogul Advertisement Five studies were recently published examining the impact of the $600 supplement on the economy. None found evidence that the benefit is broadly discouraging work among the jobless.
The lapsed federal benefit has been a significant source of friction in stimulus negotiations between congressional Democrats and top White House officials. Talks have stretched on for over two weeks with few signs of progress.
President Donald Trump threatened on Friday to circumvent Congress and take executive action on enhanced unemployment benefits among other priorities if negotiations with Democrats collapse. But it remains unclear what unilateral authority he can draw from as Congress controls spending. It raises the risk of legal challenges that could delay federal aid. Advertisement ""You're trying to make a dollar last way longer as if it was $100 dollars"" The timing of the next stimulus bill is important, as millions of Americans are going without the needed extra $600 each week while Congress debates the package. The uncertainty of the timeline makes it even more difficult for out-of-work Americans to plan for the future.

The substitute teacher was furloughed in March when schools shut down, and went 11 weeks before getting her first unemployment check due to delays in the state system, she said.

"Warren Buffett's company reported an 87% jump in its secondquarter profit as the value of its investment portfolio increased with the stock market, but it took a roughly $10 billion write down on the value of its aircraft parts manufacturing business because of the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. 8, 2020, 6:46 PM IST Share this:
OMAHA, Neb. Warren Buffett’s company reported an 87% jump in its second-quarter profit as the value of its investment portfolio increased with the stock market, but it took a roughly $10 billion write down on the value of its aircraft parts manufacturing business because of the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said Saturday that it earned $26.3 billion, or $16,314 per Class A share, during the second quarter. That’s up from $14.1 billion, or $8,608 per share, a year ago.
Berkshire said it cut the value of its Precision Castparts unit because of how much the pandemic has hurt air travel and businesses that support that airline industry.
Buffett has long said Berkshires operating earnings offer a better view of quarterly performance because they exclude investments and derivatives, which can vary widely. By that measure, Berkshires operating earnings declined 10% to $5.5 billion, or $3,420.48 per Class A share, as most of its businesses were hurt by restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic. That’s down from $6.1 billion, or $3,754.83 per share.
The analysts surveyed by FactSet expected operating earnings per Class A share of $3,182.06.
Berkshire was holding nearly $147 billion cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter, but Buffett did use $5.1 billion during the quarter to repurchase Berkshire shares.
Buffett also found a way to use more of that cash after the quarter ended. First, he agreed to buy Dominion Energys natural gas pipeline and storage business for $4 billion and take on $5.7 billion of Dominion debt. Then Buffetts company bought roughly $2.1 billion worth of Bank of America stock in late July and early August to give it control of 11.9% of the bank’s stock. Also Watch

Warren Buffett's company reported an 87% jump in its second-quarter profit as the value of its investment portfolio increased with the stock market, but it took a roughly $10 billion write down on the value of its aircraft parts manufacturing business because of the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said Saturday that it earned $26.3 billion, or $16,314 per Class A share, during the second quarter. That's up from $14.1 billion, or $8,608 per share, a year ago.
Berkshire said it cut the value of its Precision Castparts unit because of how much the pandemic has hurt air travel and businesses that support that airline industry.
Buffett has long said Berkshire's operating earnings offer a better view of quarterly performance because they exclude investments and derivatives, which can vary widely. By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings declined 10% to $5.5 billion, or $3,420.48 per Class A share, as most of its businesses were hurt by restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic.

That's down from $6.1 billion, or $3,754.83 per share. The analysts surveyed by FactSet expected operating earnings per Class A share of $3,182.06.
Berkshire was holding nearly $147 billion cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter, but Buffett did use $5.1 billion during the quarter to repurchase Berkshire shares.
Buffett also found a way to use more of that cash after the quarter ended. First, he agreed to buy Dominion Energy's natural gas pipeline and storage business for $4 billion and take on $5.7 billion of Dominion debt.
Then Buffett's company bought roughly $2.1 billion worth of Bank of America stock in late July and early August to give it control of 11.9% of the bank's stock.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. owns more than 90 companies, including BNSF railroad and insurance, utility, furniture and jewelry businesses. The company also has major investments in such companies as Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola and Bank of America."

Berkshire said it cut the value of its Precision Castparts unit because of how much the pandemic has hurt air travel and businesses that support that airline industry. Precision Castparts cut about 10,000 jobs, or about 30% of its workforce, during the first half of the year as it responded to the reduced demand.
Buffett has long said Berkshire’s operating earnings offer a better view of quarterly performance because they exclude investments and derivatives, which can vary widely. By that measure, Berkshire’s operating earnings declined 10% to $5.5 billion, or $3,420.48 per Class A share, as most of its businesses were hurt by restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic. That's down from $6.1 billion, or $3,754.83 per share.
The analysts surveyed by FactSet expected operating earnings per Class A share of $3,182.06.
The pandemic's impact on Berkshire's businesses was significant, but Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said it may not have been as bad as expected, partly because Geico insurance and BNSF railroad performed well during the quarter.
Like all auto insurers, Geico benefited from lower claims because there were fewer accidents as people drove less with many people working from home. It reported a $2.1 billion underwriting profit in the quarter, up from $393 million a year ago. Also, a $2.5 billion in premium reductions Geico is offering customers because of the lower claims will be spread over the coming year as people renew policies instead of taking effect all in the second quarter when most other insurers sent refunds.
BNSF's profit declined 15% to $1.1 billion during the quarter as the number of shipments it handled fell 18%. But the railroad was able to cut its operating expenses 26% to help offset the lower volume. Shanahan said BNSF performed better than most other major railroads.
Berkshire was holding nearly $147 billion cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter, but Buffett did use $5.1 billion during the quarter to repurchase Berkshire shares, which is the biggest buyback since Berkshire relaxed its policy on repurchases in 2018.

"Tejas Khoday &quot;I need a favour. Can you take a look at my father's portfolio and tell me why the returns were poor, what's wrong with it?&quot; bemoaned a friend from earlier times, whom I met over a quick lunch. I was in a hurry to get back to the office. Weekdays were busy and stock markets were roaring, after the recent crash in March. Traded volumes were shooting through the roof and new &amp;amp; younger clients were jumping into the market by the dozen. At a first look, the portfolio seemed diversified and consisted of well-known companies like Apollo Tyres, Raymond, CESC, Jindal Stainless, Tata Chemicals, Birla Corporation, State Bank of India, ITC and a few others, bought almost 10 years ago, probably in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. A cursory research of the top 8 holdings revealed considerable under performance, while financial parameters looked cheap and offered value. Little more granular look at the sales and profitability over the last 10 years showed inconsistent performance, marked by pitiable returns. A case of value investing not yielding the desired returns. The concept of value investing versus one that is considered to be outperforming the market, generally comes from the fundamental stock analysis. When it comes to comparing the two fundamental approaches of stock market investing – Growth and Value – any results that can be seen, must be evaluated in terms of time horizon and the amount of volatility. As I pondered on the returns, a thought flashed through my mind. Was value investing style slowly dying? A tried, tested and a proven method of investing, practised over many decades by many famed investors, was gradually losing its ability to deliver noteworthy returns. The reasons for the same seem to be many. Since the global financial crisis, to boost economic growth, most countries pumped in copious amounts of liquidity. With interest rates diving south and ease of capital availability, entrepreneurs paved the way for new market segments of products and services. Boosted by high consumption demand and pricing power, the growth of these modernistic companies took off and so did the participation of the retail investors. Armed with prospects of high growth, split-second information reach, large doses of capital infusion began to push the new age companies to stratospheric valuations. The stock prices continued to rocket northwards, and retail as well as institutional investors shed the time proven principles of staying invested for a long period of time. Old economy sectors and stocks – infrastructure, construction, public sector companies, metals &amp;amp; mining - started witnessing dwindling traded volumes, clearly highlighting the shift to consumer discretionary, fintech, FMCG and other consumption focussed sectors. Seth Klarman’s words, &quot;The single greatest edge an investor can have is a long-term orientation&quot; seem to be slowly fading away. Economy was disconnected from the stock market was an accepted fact in most investment circles, but by how much and for how long, were the points of debate. It is a wakeup call for those who believe in old-style value investing and this caution comes from none other than the Professor of Finance at Stern School of Business at New York University (NYU), Aswath Damodaran, often referred to as the 'Dean of Valuation'. In a recent interview he did say &quot;I think book value has completely lost its meaning. Value investing is not just buying low price to earnings or price to book stocks&quot;. It has become much more than that – was a mutual feeling. Reflecting more on this statement, it is clear now. Value investing has lost out to growth investing over the last decade. Investors preferred growth opportunities and embellished their portfolios with stocks that were able to deliver high growth, continuously. Dividends weren't a priority like earlier times; capital appreciation appeared to be the only measure, a feeling which would not be appreciated by many. Any lapse in the quarterly performance was not taken too kindly and the impact expressed immediately on the market price, as witnessed recently in stocks which were more than priced to perfection, even bordering on super valuations (E.g. Nestle, Bajaj Finance, Asian Paints). Can companies continue to deliver superlative financial performance, quarter-after-quarter, forever? Definitely not possible and the streak is bound to meet a speed bump sometime in the future. Similar thoughts would surely be on the minds of many value investors and growth investors. The need to balance the risk of capital loss by a self-incorporated margin of safety to the portfolio, while aiming for good capital appreciation, yearly dividends leaves us with the only option – Blended Investing. In a steady state economic scenario, value investing brings the comfort of holding good stocks at a fair value, low volatility and a predictable earnings growth. In a lower interest rate environment, growth investing offers the possibility of extremely high earnings albeit with a higher volatility. As economic cycles alternate from time to time, a portfolio of value and growth stocks could reduce the risk, smoothening the volatility and thereby ensuring better returns. As I sit down to pen down my thoughts in reply, I make a mental note of absolute certainties. Extremities in investing need to be toned down. A diversified portfolio is a must and cannot be avoided. Both, capital appreciation and dividends are desired, probably in a more measured manner that matches the risk profile and prevailing economic scenario. If an octogenarian and widely successful value investor like Warren Buffett can course-correct his investment style to match the evolving economic situation and opportunities, we surely can do too. Value investing is not dead; it is just blending into a new environment, and investors are yet to realize it. The author is Co-Founder &amp;amp; CEO at FYERS.

"Matt Phillips Denmark is a place of hygge, happiness and — in the face of a global downturn — a high-performing stock market. The tiny and trade-dependent northern European nation’s stock indexes are easily beating out the S&amp;amp;P 500, which is up slightly for the year, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 and the Stoxx Europe 600 index, which are both in negative territory. The Danish indexes, such as the OMX Copenhagen 25, are up more than 15% in 2020, or more than 21% if you calculate its return in dollar terms. That’s within spitting distance of other market bright spots, like the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which has climbed about 23% on the strength of lockdown-friendly companies like Amazon and Apple. What accounts for such a stellar performance? Experts say it’s a combination of several factors: an effective response to the coronavirus crisis (assisted by the country’s robust social safety net), a collection of companies well positioned to weather the crisis and a knack for well-balanced management. The main contributor to the Danish stocks’ performance is a matter of what the companies do rather than where they do it: Roughly 50% of the market capitalization of Danish stocks is in almost recession-proof health care and pharmaceutical companies — a solid portfolio in the midst of a pandemic. “The mix of the Danish market is completely different than you see in the global market, and there you have, sort of, the explanation for why has the Danish market performed so much better,” said Carsten Jantzen Leth, head of Danish Equities at Nordea Asset Management. Share prices have soared for large Danish health companies such as Coloplast — a major player in the market for colostomy pouches, continence, and skin and wound care treatments — and Genmab, a biotech company specializing in cancer treatments. Investors looking for safety have helped drive Coloplast up more than 25% and Genmab more than 50% for the year. But towering above them all is Novo Nordisk. Worth roughly $150 billion, the Bagsvaerd-based company by itself accounts for roughly 15% of the market capitalization of the OMX Copenhagen 25 index, which is owned by Nasdaq Global Indexes. It’s one of the dominant suppliers in the world market for insulin and diabetes treatments, a business that is well insulated from the ups and downs of the global economy. “If people need insulin, they need it whether there’s a recession or not,” said Henrik Drusebjerg, global chief strategist at Danske Bank, the largest Danish bank. While profit expectations for the wider Stoxx Europe 600 index have collapsed by more than 35%, analysts covering Novo Nordisk expect profits to be up about 8% in 2020, even during the worst global downturn since the Great Depression. Its shares are up about 5% this year. Much of Danish companies’ business — about 20% — comes from the pandemic-plagued United States, but a significant portion also comes from within the country’s borders. And the country’s efforts to flatten the curve and resume economic activity have also helped stock prices. “It was evidently clear that Denmark had got on top of the virus quickly,” said David Oxley, an economist focusing on Nordic economies at Capital Economics, a research consultancy in London. “They were one of the first to shut down and one of the first to reopen.” Denmark has a generous unemployment system in normal times but took additional measures in response to the pandemic. Under a short-term relief program, the government picked up the tab if an employer cut a worker’s hours. Only at the end of June did the government start the clock on its normal unemployment benefits, which pay about 90% of a worker’s salary for up to a year — meaning jobless workers can count on significant support through the middle of 2021, Oxley said. The pandemic did have an effect, of course. Unemployment spiked to 5.6% in May after hovering at 3.7% in February, and gross domestic product fell 2% in the first quarter, the worst decline in more than a decade. But in both metrics, the changes were mere blips compared with other developed nations. And then there is something harder to quantify — the ability of Danish management teams to find a middle path through challenging times. Ivy International Core Equity Fund, seeing the structural advantages of Novo Nordisk, established a more than $30 million position in the stock in June, when it bought over 500,000 shares. And it held on to shares it owned of A.P. Moller Maersk, the Danish shipping giant hit hard by the sharp downturn in global trade. “It’s rare for us to have two names there,” in Denmark, said John C. Maxwell, a portfolio manager on the fund. “It’s a heavy weight for us relative to normal.” Maxwell and his co-managers believe both companies are solid long-term bets — even if Maersk is off roughly 9% this year. (It was down more than 47% in late March.) That’s partly because Maersk, like Novo Nordisk, holds a commanding position in its core market. Even though freight volumes are expected to fall as much as 18% in the second quarter, Maersk’s profits are expected to be roughly flat compared with last year, according to analysts. That is a credit to the talent of Nordic executive teams to operate cyclical businesses at a steady, profitable pace, said Maxwell, who has managed the international stock fund for 14 years. In his experience, he said, different countries can have different approaches to management. German executives can be a bit too slow to produce results, while U.S. and British firms can be a bit too focused on short-term gains at the expense of long-term strategy. But Danish and other Nordic companies seem to have figured out a way to blend the two approaches. “They just generally have a nice tempo about how they run the business,” he said, “trying to hit the quarters, but not sacrificing the long term to do so.” c.2020 The New York Times Company"

"Chinese app TikTok has threatened to take legal action against the US after President Donald Trump ordered companies to stop doing business with the app within 45 days.
The executive order used by US President Trump outlining the ban has “shocked” TikTok.
The Chinese company said it would “pursue all remedies available” to “ensure the rule of law is not discarded”, says a BBC report .
In a major escalation in Washington’s stand-off with Beijing, President Trump issued a similar order against another Chinese multi-purpose messaging, social media and mobile payment app WeChat, developed by Tencent.
The report quoted Tencent as saying: “We are reviewing the executive order to get a full understanding.”
The US President Trump has decided to ban the Chinese app, TokTok app, citing national security concerns.
The executive order claimed both the Chinese apps gather data on Chinese nationals visiting the US, allowing Beijing “to keep tabs” on them.
Earlier India banned 59 Chinese apps including popular app TikTok, citing security reasons amidst border tensions between India and China.
However, following Trump’s executive order, the Chinese company is now in talks to sell its American business to Microsoft.
They have to reach a deal until September 15, a deadline set by President Trump.
TikTok, owned by China’s ByteDance, said it had attempted to engage with the US government for nearly a year “in good faith”.
“What we encountered instead was that the administration paid no attention to facts, dictated terms of an agreement without going through standard legal processes, and tried to insert itself into negotiations between private businesses,” TikTok said.
President Trump’s executive order against short-video sharing app TikTok and messaging service WeChat are the latest measure in Trump administration’s campaign against China.
The US government on Thursday recommended that Chinese firms listed on the US stock markets should be delisted unless they provided regulators with access to their audited accounts."

I am very very happy to see bad results. Sanwaria future is good only when the promoters and management changes. Continually bad results three quarters in row means Anil Agarwal and family cannot manage the company now. Only one choice sell it. Big FMCG players are always on lookout for weak players in the market to acquire them. If Sanwaria share price needs to reach three digit or four digit in future only possible by takeover. If Sanwaria had posted good results I would have been very very disappointed. I will buy more of Sanwaria shares once Expression on Interest showing bidders interested document comes out from IRP in future. I have never lost money in stock market in last 21 years. As my user name suggests I Invest Smart. Wishing happy weekend and good luck.
jojoindian - You are really so emotional that you should not be in the stock market. Get out of the market as soon as you can. Are you in LOVE with Anil Ambani that you are shedding tears fro him. Clearly Anil Ambani lost heavily as he was having playboy traits and was not concentrating on business.
"US President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference in Bedminster, New Jersey, on August 7, 2020. JIM WATSON / AFP President Donald Trump vowed on Saturday to scrap the payroll tax , a funding mechanism for Social Security and Medicare , if he wins re-election. ""If I'm victorious on November 3rd, I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax,"" Trump said at a press conference announcing executive actions on coronavirus relief. Experts say the move to cut payroll taxes would further erode the shaky finances of both programs. President Donald Trump pledged on Saturday to scrap the payroll tax, a key mechanism that's used to fund Social Security and Medicare.
""If I'm victorious on November 3rd, I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax,"" Trump said at a press conference. ""I'm going to make them all permanent.""
He later said: ""In other words, I'll extend it beyond the end of the year and terminate the tax. So we'll see what happens."" Advertisement The payroll tax funds Medicare and Social Security The federal government imposes a 15.3% levy on wages known as the payroll tax. It's evenly divided between employers and workers, and most of it goes to fund Social Security. It also helps to finance Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people over the age of 65 and for younger Americans with disabilities. In an April 2020 Gallup poll , 58% of retirees said they relied on Social Security for a ""major source"" of their income.
Trump's unexpected comments on Saturday came as he signed an array of executive actions aimed at providing relief to Americans during the pandemic. Among them was a deferral in the collection of payroll taxes , which he is waiving from September through the end of the year for workers earning below $104,000 a year. Advertisement But it doesn't forgive workers' payments outright since the power to eliminate taxes or change the tax code rests with Congress. As workers and employers are still legally on the hook to make those payments next year, experts say it's unlikely that workers will see a bump in their wages anytime soon. Companies are more likely to continue withholding the money from paychecks.

Many economists say it would not benefit the 31 million unemployed Americans, either. Advertisement Congressional action to eliminate the tax entirely is also improbable, and may instead set off a fraught debate over the federal programs' fiscal futures.
Medicare and Social Security's finances are already shaky Economists from the left-leaning Center for American Progress warned on Thursday that Trump's push to enact a payroll tax cut could further erode their shaky finances.
""Trump's scheme would weaken the Social Security and Medicare trust funds by diverting the revenue from the employee portion of Social Security and Medicare taxes, and potentially the employer's share of Medicare taxes, from the programs' trust funds,"" a memo from the organization said.

This meeting presided over by a pro-Pakistani adviser to PM , says BD intelligence officials, have “sinister connotations”.
Some of those in the meeting are aspirants for the top job, others of anti-Awami League dispensation. After a regime change plot by a ‘Major Power’ which had this ‘pro-Pakistani adviser’ leading the machinations with his son , Bangladesh agencies foiled the plot , partly by sheer luck when a retired military participant spilled the beans to a leading intelligence agency in the country by meeting its officer in Bangladesh embassy in Washington .
Then the agency arm-twisted another participant from a smaller anti -AL party and got him to confess.
Now the DIG (Confidential) of Bangladesh police has asked Bangladesh Deputy High Comission in Kolkata to find out the place of stay of some of the conspirators who came to the city to meet diplomats of a ‘Major Power’ in February for the first two meetings.
All subsequent meetings were held online in virtual mode.
The letter asks the mission to check on places of stay of the conspirators, the fact of their travel being already confirmed from airport immigration records.
The ‘pro-Pakistani adviser’ has unleashed a major insinuation campaign against senior BBC journalist Subir Bhaumik after the expose of his evil empire built on more than $800 million bank default and more than 50000 crore Taka in money laundering.
The secret meeting on Friday night took place in the corporate guest house of this ‘pro-Pakistani adviser’ for firming up a plan to oust Aziz, who is otherwise in control of the army.
“This small gang of generals and brigadiers are enmeshed with the pro-Pak adviser and they see Aziz as a major bulwark against their evil plans because the army chief is totally loyal to PM Sheikh Hasina,” said a top Bangladesh intelligence source.
A recent trend of getting key military appointments initiated by PMO, which leaves Army Hqs no choice, has seen the removal of key aides of Gen Aziz from crucial positions.
The removal of Brig Salam from the position of DMI is one of the many such appointments orchestrated by this pro-Pakistan adviser.
There is confirmation of the meeting from other diplomatic sources in Dhaka — it is open secret most big missions have intelligence officers under consular cover.
The meeting resolved to (a) mount maximum pressure on PM Hasina to remove General Aziz (b) appoint one Lt-Gen from their cabal and another to a post like Indian-style CDS (c) mount maximum pressure to take the ‘pro-Pakistani adviser’ into the cabinet and give him Defence portfolio so far handled by PM Hasina herself (d) ultimately project this ‘pro-Pakistani adviser’ as PM and push Hasina to Presidency where she would just be titular head .
It is reliably learnt that this ‘pro-Pakistani adviser’, a Rasputin type character with strong fundamentalist and global jihadi connections (a high level level enquiry has been started by Bangladesh on tip-off from India about terror financing by big corporates), has engineered squabbles in the PM household by playing on different personalities there to trigger a succession question.
India is firm on backing PM Sheikh Hasina to the hilt , despite confusing reports engineered by this ‘Rasputin’ backed Media.
“We have no reason to see her go because she has done so much for us . It is actually payback time and we are considering some major concessions to Bangladesh, from water to world affairs issues. We intend to push for an amicable repatriation of Rohingyas, maybe after the Myanmar polls in November,” said a top Indian foreign ministry source.
The source said India is ‘hardly bothered’ with an occasional videocon between Pakistan PM Imran Khan and Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina —
“Yes we don’t like Kashmir raised, but Pakistan will raise Kashmir even in Covid related meetings or if there is a conference on Mars and Moon,” the source said.
Bangladesh agencies complain that this ‘pro-Pakistani adviser’ has forced them to avoid ‘hard questioning ‘ of detained retired Lt General Sarwardy who was pulled up for his insidious social media interview by Kanak Sarwar . Such social media output were seen as key to a regime change in Bangladesh by igniting huge popular unrest on pattern of the Orange Revolution in Ukraine.
This adviser has also blocked attempts by agencies to interrogate him and his son for involvement in the alleged regime change plot by a ‘Major Power’.
Bangladesh intelligence officials told that they were still awaiting clear instructions on a few important people who were allegedly linked to it.
“We want to interrogate a few bigshots but they are powerful and are obviously active to thwart investigations, even influence them. We know that a PM adviser who managed to quash court cases on his involvement in both 1996 and 2010-11 stock market scams,” said a top official in one of the agencies.
He said the adviser has been barred from PMO and is under surveillance but it was not yet clear whether he can be questioned, as direction on that is awaited at the highest level.
India has watched with unease this adviser’s rise in the Bangladesh PMO and his ability to place his own people at many key positions has been amazing.
Intelligence has details about this adviser’s house in Saudi Arabia which he shared with his in-law who is a BNP leader and businessman, which had become the key staging point for the purported regime change plot.
It is in this house not far from the holy sites that this adviser and his cohorts confabulated with the ‘operations’ cadre of a ‘Major Power’ and later with ISI officials from Pakistan.
The ISI biggest station for operations against India and Bangladesh is located in Dubai, both the legal and illegal residencies meaning those ISI operatives using diplomatic cover and those with cover assignments.
The ISI team in Dubai includes an officer who has studied with the son of the Bangladesh PM Adviser in Karachi – one who is a periodic visitor to Bangladesh under business cover.
The Adviser has outwitted the Bangladesh Foreign Office by convincing the highest decision making authority that China (by its clout on Myanmar government) and Pakistan (by its control over ARSA and other jihadi elements) held the key to Bangladesh’s Rohingya problem and that India had no real role to play in it.
“The BJP’s meaningless rhetoric like calling Bangladeshis termites and India’s less-than-competent diplomatic team in Dhaka has helped this Adviser boost Pakistani influence in PMO and Bangladesh decision making ,” said long time Bangladesh watcher Sukharanjan Dasgupta, author of ‘Midnight Massacre’ , an account of the coup that killed Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
India is sending a tough diplomat, Vikram Doraiswamy, to replace the current envoy , Reeva Ganguly Das, a master in “gayoka-Nayika” soft diplomacy but at sea in handing fast changing political dynamics where Pakistan and China are making determined attempts to woo Bangladesh.
Top diplomats of Bangladesh and Pakistan have held talks recently to promote bilateral relations under the active initiative of the PM’s adviser.
“Both sides agreed to promote bilateral relations with a forward-looking approach,” Pakistan’s High Commissioner in Dhaka Imran Ahmed Siddiqui said on Anadolu Agency.
Referring to the talks with Bangladeshi Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen on July 1, Siddiqui added: “The two sides briefed each other on the COVID-19 situation in their respective countries and precautionary and preventive measures being taken.”
Siddiqui said: “Pakistan believes there is a huge potential in bilateral economic and commercial cooperation. We must work together to realize this potential with a focus on bringing our respective private sectors closer.”
“We want stronger relations with brotherly Bangladesh in all walks of life. We share common bonds of history, religion and culture,” he added.
The Bangladeshi Foreign Ministry did not issue a statement about the meeting and the story was almost missing in Bangladesh media with only the Turkish Anadolu Agency covering it.
Some media reports suggests that the Bangladesh government has been asked by security agencies to sack or at least suspend the Adviser pending investigations but that may not be possible because he has ‘far too much influence where it matters.”
Respected media outlets in Bangladesh like ‘Daily Star’ and ‘Prothom Alo’ and even the ‘New York Times ‘ had reported that the corporate bigshot used his huge influence in the Awami League to silence the 1996 and 2010-11 stock scams before his influence multiplied several times when he went on to become a MP and a PM adviser with the rank of cabinet minister.
Bangladesh and global media reports had suggested that the corporate bigwig said to be prime accused behind the scams also figures in two secret Bangladesh Bank Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) report, one on Money Laundering and another on Bank Defaults which is eating into the vitals of the nation’s burgeoning economy.
FIU was the brainchild of former Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman whose removal from the position was orchestrated by this shady corporate boss on alleged dereliction of duty when a transfer of millions of dollars meant for BB ended up in Filipino casinos.
Rahman’s subordinates responsible for overseeing such transfers were possibly involved but the BB governor, a highly respected economist whose work on Tagore as a socio-economic thinker is path breaking, was unaware and only took the blame for the fiasco because he stood by the principle of collective responsibility.
Both FIU reports put this powerful business magnate on top of their list — the biggest bank defaulted and the biggest money launderer.
Like Rahman, former Bangladesh finance minister A M A Muhith was also apprehensive of the damage this business magnate was causing to Bangladesh’s economy.
Muhith blocked several files involving his companies – so this business magnate orchestrated Muhith’s removal and replacement by his close confidante , the new finance minister, so that he would never be pulled up for his huge bank defaults and his considerable money laundering.
It is rumoured that this shady business magnate is also involved in helping the money laundering operations of a key member of the PM household, something that is already in the radar of the US Inland Revenue Service. But now that he is part of a ‘regime change plot’ these investigations may wane."
"By Shuli Ren
Over the past decade, it’s almost been too easy for Americans to manage their wealth. A textbook 60/40 portfolio — in its simplest incarnation, exposure to the S&P 500 Index and Treasury bonds — was an effortless winner. The U.S. boasted the world’s best stock market , and bonds, apart from offering interest income , provided a nice hedge against equity risks.
Now we live in extraordinary times that demand a reshuffle. Swapping out some bonds for gold and some U.S. technology stocks for Chinese ones could offer a better hedge: Both can be considered credit default swaps against President Donald Trump’s chaotic policymaking.
You could argue that the wreckage left by Covid-19, combined with what’s quickly shaping up to be a cold war between the world’s two largest economies, is the closest we’ve come to World War III. And just like wartime episodes of the past, we’re seeing disrupted global supply chains, border lockdowns and restricted movements in labor.
War is inflationary. The cheap car parts made in China’s inland city of Wuhan can no longer land in the U.S., and your French wine could cost more as transportation logistics get trickier. Moreover, the Federal Reserve has been flooding its financial system with cash. In just three months, assets held by the central bank ballooned by two-thirds, to almost $7 trillion. To make matters worse, the Fed is mulling a more relaxed stance toward inflation , ready to abandon preemptive rate hikes — even though consumer expectations have been ticking up since May.
As I’ve argued in a recent piece for Bloomberg Businessweek, bonds are no longer effective equity hedges in an ultra-low-rate world that faces inflationary pressure; gold can do a better job. But after a neck-breaking rally, it’s natural to ask if we’re already too late to the game.
History can be our guide. After the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, gold broke out and continued marching higher until September 2011, even as Tea Party belt-tighteners took control of the national narrative in the 2010 midterm election. A decade on, the Republican Party’s libertarian wing has all but disappeared, and is replaced by a cross-the-aisle nod to modern monetary theorists, who brush aside fiscal austerity. The Tea Party is no longer here to sour the gold rally.
Meanwhile, since we’re at war, might it be smart to hedge against the possibility of losing? This cold war isn’t over a plot of land or sea, but domination over next-generation technology.
The U.S. has the absolute advantage now, with chip and robotic designs far ahead of China’s, but that edge is slipping away. While Washington is wrangling over trillions of dollars of stimulus to fend off a recession caused by waves of coronavirus outbreaks, China, which has the pandemic relatively under control, is only strengthening its tech resolve.
For Beijing, it’s killing two birds with one stone. The $1.4 trillion hard tech invesment is the nation’s new fiscal stimulus package. Instead of building more roads to nowhere, China is installing 5G base stations.
It’s high time to consider diversifying from U.S. stocks, anyhow. There have been nagging worries about the market being on a tear even with the economy in the dumps. Meanwhile, Big Tech has become too dominant, with the top five mega-cap names now accounting for more than 20 per cent of the S&P 500 and its entire gain this year. This might help explain why mainland firms that recently went public in New York are outperforming their U.S. counterparts, despite the Trump administration’s attempt to delist China Inc.
Now, I am not advocating that investors plow their money into China’s big tech companies, because they face the exact same problems that U.S. Big Tech has — overbought stocks and impossible expectations. This year’s passive flows only worsened the concentration risk of benchmark indexes. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. account for a third of the MSCI China Index and about 14 per cent of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.
Rather, investors should do their homework on smaller hard-tech companies. The truth is, once you identify a promising tech seedling, it doesn’t take a venture capitalist’s patience to watch it blossom. India’s Reliance Industries Ltd. joined the Century Club — stocks with over $100 billion market cap — in just three months. Tencent is another example of a melt-up.
Good wealth management is all about diversification. If you’re unsure of Trump’s wartime strategies, add some of gold and China exposure to your portfolio."
