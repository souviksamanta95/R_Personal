Diversion basically serves two purposes: the essentially Chinese products enjoy duty-free access and it also doesn't reflect in China's overall massive trade surplus with India, which stood at a massive $48 billion in FY20.
After Singapore and Hong Kong, Vietnam has emerged as the third Asian trade partner, which counts on massive Chinese investments, to turn its usual trade deficit with India into a decent surplus in a span of just three years.
Between FY18 and FY20, India's trade balance with Vietnam swang from a surplus of $2.8 billion to a deficit of $2.2 billion, according to official data (https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/china-factor-indias-trade-with-vietnam-swings-from-big-surplus-to-large-deficit/2019048/).
While India's imports from the south-east Asian nation jumped from $5 billion in FY18 to $7.3 billion in FY20, its exports crashed from $7.8 billion to $5.1 billion during this period.
