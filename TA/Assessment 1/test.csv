		        By IANS
      	  NEW DELHI: Sixty-one per cent Indians are experiencing mental health-related issues because of the uncertainty and looming financial crisis during the lockdown, said a survey.

According to the 'Rebooting 2020: A Story of Covid-19, and Shifting Perceptions' survey by The Mavericks India, Gen-Z and millennials have been impacted the most with 27 per cent of Gen-Z and 19 per cent of millennials expressing that the crisis has taken a significant toll on their mental health.

Baby boomers are least impacted or perhaps better experienced and prepared to handle the crisis. Furthermore, women are struggling more than men as their workload has increased significantly with them carrying multiple responsibilities without any assistance from domestic helpers, the survey added.

The survey was conducted during the period of April-May, collecting 600 responses via an online survey tool.

Work-from-home - the new normal?

Around 46 per cent of CXOs surveyed believe that working remotely will be the most significant change in the post-COVID-19 world. Many CXOs are exploring options to get a major portion of their workforce to work from home for a longer period of time post-COVID, or permanently in some cases. With salary cuts implemented with immediate effect across all industries, the WFH proposition offers saving time and money while bringing down the real estate costs for the employers significantly. WFH is being touted as a win-win scenario.

On the contrary, the workforce is itching to get back to working from office with 75 per cent Indians finding WFH very challenging and further blurring the boundaries between work and personal lives.

Indian economy's road to recovery - a bleak future

Around 90 per cent CXOs expect the recovery to be slow and painful and this is likely to be reflected heavily in their decision-making as they try and navigate the turbulent times. A whopping 72 per cent Indians do not expect the economy to recover in less than a year with 26 per cent being further pessimistic, not expecting the recovery before two years.

Reduced dependencies on China the next big move for India?

Around 51 per cent of the CXOs and 40 per cent of other respondents believe that China will suffer a global backlash as the world perceives that China could have responded more responsibly in handling the crisis that has gotten the world down on its knees.

Media consumption shifts to the online medium

Indians are tuned in to Zoom and Google Hangouts/Meets for most part of the day, besides being pushed to bring in the digital transformation to some of their most loyal habits like consumption of traditional media. 70 per cent of the respondents are reliant on online news sources and apps and only 3 per cent of the millennials hold on to their old habits.

Sustainability is the name of the game

Fifty eight per cent respondents are likely to have increased appreciation towards sustainable environmental practices while 63 per cent are committed to leading a healthier lifestyle with a special focus on physical fitness and building better immunity.

Say no to travel till there's a vaccine

The travel and hospitality business is likely to take the longest time to recover as social distancing will continue to be the new normal for a while and definitely until they are vaccine-protected. At least 67 per cent Indians are not likely to travel for the next six months unless it is absolutely necessary.

""People went into unplanned alcohol withdrawal which ultimately led to a cluster of suicides. This was an India-specific feature."""

"9","While Pathare applauded government efforts in the past decade to increase its capacities in mental healthcare, he said India is still left with a large number of people whose suffering goes untreated."
"10","""Mental healthcare in India has undoubtedly improved in the past 10 years. But has it improved enough? Undoubtedly not."""
"11","War movies usually give me goosebumps, when I see the passion, drive and force with which soldiers march towards enemy lines. Their focused eyes, war cries and loud thumping feet that are meant to intimidate the enemy, blare at me through the sound system, my living room vibrating and with it, my heart pounds. I have always wondered what made them walk into the approaching blood bath, what goes on in their minds and what they felt while doing so."
"12","Persistence and courage have always intrigued me. The truth is, though, that these do not occur in isolation. There is a moment of choice, which is a culmination of patience, bravery, trust and hope. What makes people stand their ground, when they know a single mistake can cost them their life, is the acceptance of vulnerability and responsibility. The realisation that they need to look out for themselves, their brothers, their cavalry and their mission. There is a persistence to survive and fight shoulder to shoulder for each other."
"13","The year 2020 will go down in history as one of legendary battle, which we fought with not only a deadly ìviral rivalî that burgeoned overnight, but also with ourselves. One that put all our learnings through history to test. We have been pushed to breaking point multiple times, but as we struggle to survive the invisible and incessant strikes of the Covid-19 virus, maybe we need to adopt a different war tactic. While the way to victory is the vaccine and medical miracles, we need to get ourselves back on our feet, persist and ìhold the lineî. It is in this defending with responsibility, patience and courage that we may find respite, solutions and liberation."
"14","Mahatma Gandhi said, ìTo lose patience is to lose the battleî, and with every passing day we hear of brothers and sisters losing their will to hold on. Patience lies in continuing to face the crisis with resilience, avoiding temptation of risky behaviour. We hear whispers of people socialising, watch friends and strangers throw away masks and face-shields exasperated with discomfort, various businesses compromising on health advisory and many such breached lines of defence."
"15","The operational definition of holding the line is to ìnot yield to the pressure of a difficult situationî and steadfastly hold on, but I feel the need to add a perspective to it. Not only does hold the line mean ìmask upî, ìsuit upî ìstock upî and actively defend yourself, but it also indicates taking responsibility for the ones fighting beside you, looking out for the injured and fight for the ones who canít protect themselves. This fight wonít be won in isolation."
"16","Truth is that if we do not hold on ìtogetherî, look out for each other, sensibly respect precautions and medical advice, stay home, socially distance as hard as it is getting with every passing day, we will see defeat, further delayed recovery and increased loss and destruction. We say we are lonely, when we are actually all united in the fight of our lives; we say are low, when we have so much reason to to be inspired and fight for; we say we canít take it anymore, when we have an evolutionary history of patience and persistence through the worst plagues and wars."
"17","Today, it is not just about ìsurvival of the fittestî, but the survival of all, as a community and who knows even as a species. Survival of the fittest, is a phrase best understood as survival of the form that will leave the most copies of itself in successive generations. Will it be us or the virus, time will tell. Darwin in 1809 said, ìIt is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one that is most responsive to change.î Today I humbly wish, he had added the word ìcollectivelyî in the end. We cannot survive alone, act in self-serving or egotistical ways this time and get away with it. There is no getting out of this battle alive, unless we respect and protect each other."
"18","This is a tough time. A time we never saw coming. A time we canít see the end of. But it is a time we need to be earnest and adamant to protect, persist, fight temptation, stay firm, be united and hold the line."
"19","If travel restrictions are relaxed, it is possible that many applications for travel with fake emergencies will also slip through the system. But in a country like ours, influence and money have already made grand weddings and parties possible despite the pandemic. Plug these gaps in the system. Donít let genuine applications fall prey to governmental highhandedness."
"20","Society has a skewed perspective on therapy ó I mean the therapy we seek for our mental health issues. Can you imagine anyone being ridiculed for seeking physical therapy for recovery from fracture or tennis elbow? Of course not ó no one can expect to heal properly from a serious injury without physiotherapy or an exercise regimen. But as soon as you replace the word 'physical' with 'mental', our attitudes toward treatment tends to shift dramatically. We have all been guilty, at various stages in our lives, of questioning the necessity and effectiveness of mental health practices. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown, mental health has not only come to the forefront but the importance of its practices has become evident. With rising numbers in cases of anxiety, stress, depression and paranoia during these testing times, it has become necessary to seek counsel and support.
In April, the Government of Maharashtra, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation and Mpower, a pioneer in Indian mental healthcare had launched a toll-free 24/7 helpline number for people to reach out and seek help for any mental health concerns during the lockdown. The helpline received around 45,000 calls in just two months of its launch ó this could just be the tip of the iceberg as India stares at what experts are calling a ""full-blown"" mental health crisis post-COVID. The maximum calls are in Marathi at 65 per cent, followed by 27 per cent in Hindi and 8 per cent in English. Even though the helpline was launched for Maharashtra, it has received calls from across the country.
What is quite concerning is that the data shows a whopping 52 per cent of the callers are anxious about what will happen post-lockdown, while 22 per cent were related to isolation and adjustment issues, 11 per cent were for depression, 5 per cent for sleep-related difficulties and 4 per cent were for exacerbation of previous mental health concerns. While the overall range of callers has been 18-85 years, the highest number of calls have a young profile in the 26ñ40 years range standing at 55 per cent. It is surprising, yet alarming to see that almost 20 per cent called the helpline but disconnected the call before they could speak to one of the mental health counsellors, reinforcing the stigma around mental health in the country and the pressing need to take the leap of faith to open up about oneís concerns."
"21","In early April, Gangamma (name changed) was found wandering on the streets of Bengaluru, dishevelled, talking to herself with garbled speech, and was brought into an emergency room by the police. She was homeless, did not know where she was, and evidently mentally ill. She needed immediate treatment, but first, she had to be screened for COVID-19."
"22","Gangamma lived on the streets uncared for and could not recall where she had been. She could have been to bus terminals and shelters, other crowded places, and come into contact with hundreds of people. She needed to be admitted for serious in-patient care in a hospital ward, but needed to be tested to protect other vulnerable women with mental illness."
"23","But guidelines issued by the Ministry of Family Health and Welfare (MFHW) did not take her into account as a category for testing; the people to be tested had to have travelled internationally, or come into contact with confirmed cases, or work in health care. The doctors had to decide what to do in the moment, especially to protect dozens of others who would be affected if she was admitted for care. Finally, she tested negative for COVID-19, but sadly, she was found to have a tumour in an X-Ray. If she was to be treated, she would need to wait until other hospitals reopened after lockdown and outpatient departments began to function."
"24","At a time with a nationwide lockdown and an uncertain future, Gangamma as a mentally ill homeless woman was left to wander alone in deserted streets, at the mercy of whoever could give her food, entirely forgotten by the state in its attempts to contain the spread of the virus."
"25","When the WHO declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020, it released a parallel briefing to emphasise the need for mental health and psychosocial services during the pandemic. The briefing anticipated a rise in stress, anxiety, and fear ‚<U+0080><U+0093> people were afraid of falling ill with an infection that had no cure, of losing livelihood, and the isolation of lockdown. The WHO anticipated that societies would have to support their populations in a time of extreme uncertainty, not only with adequate essential services, but active counselling and support."
"26","In India, mental health institutions across the country had to ensure that the chronic mentally ill had access to medication ‚<U+0080><U+0093> especially people with severe mental disorders (SMDs) like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and even major depression. The system had to prepare both for the existing needs of persons with mental illness, and the anticipated need for increased psychological support of citizens, with uncertainty looming large about the economy and the spread of COVID-19."
"27","In Karnataka, the advantage of having NIMHANS in Bengaluru made things less tenuous. In alliance with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of the Government of Karnataka, medicines were brought to all District Mental Health Programmes (DMHPs) and tele counselling services had begun by early April. All 30 districts in Karnataka had functional DMHPs which had a weekly Tuesday mental health clinic, and practitioners trained in offering psychosocial support to those seeking medical care."
"28","By mid-April, over a lakh tablets had to be sent to pharmacies where patients could use their latest prescription to buy medicines. Doctors from NIMHANS began to contact patients on record from 2014, to inform them about the availability of medication. But there were 1,60,000 patients, and phone numbers were often found to be invalid or inaccurate, and not all patients lived at convenient distances from primary or district health centres, say doctors who are part of the process."
"29","By mid-April, tele counselling helplines were offered across the country, run by hospitals and private medical facilities with social workers and nurses. Around 1,000 psychiatrists and clinical psychologists are now offering tele counselling via helplines, even as they continue to offer consultations via telephone or video when available, and 300 volunteers answer helplines for the general public. The Government of Karnataka began to air All India Radio programmes and a YouTube channel, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Jagruti Karnataka"" to raise awareness on methods of coping. Simultaneously, webinars were conducted to train nurses, doctors, ASHA workers and district health professionals to deal with the mental health fallouts of the pandemic."
"30","NIMHANS receives 3,000-4,000 phone calls a day. Those who were diagnosed with COVID-19 were struggling with self-blame and fear of social ostracism. Adolescents live with all their immediate hopes and dreams for the future suspended with exams indefinitely postponed. Pregnant and postpartum women are worried about access to medical care. There were complaints about stress, anxiety about the future, domestic distress and substance abuse."
"31","Dr Naveen, Head of Community Psychiatry, says these tend to be ‚<U+0080><U+009C>normal responses to an abnormal situation‚<U+0080>ù and encourages those who call to maintain structured activity, exercise, food and diet. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Social distancing does not mean emotional distancing,‚<U+0080>ù he says, and it is important that people are encouraged to stay in touch with one another."
"32","Patients already hospitalised in mental health facilities now had to be supported to understand social distancing and hand hygiene. For those with degenerative conditions like dementia, this new information is often difficult to understand. For those with Obsessive Compulsive Disorders, especially the washers, the fear of the virus was manifold. ""With the WHO recommending repeated handwashing, it has been difficult to keep patients in remission and many have relapsed...fear of contracting COVID-19 is another new symptom‚<U+0080>ù, said Dr Muralidharan, a professor at NIMHANS."
"33","The real need is to build community-based capacity in order to handle local issues long after the acute phase of the epidemic. A small team of peer counslelors working under a local administrator and trained on established models ñ such as Dr. Vikram Patelís†Sangath†or the†Atmiyata model†by Centre for Mental Health Law and Policy (CMHLP) ñ might be the way forward. This will require a close partnership between civil society, local administration, and a standardized training and technology backbone, if it is to deliver consistent quality support. Local anchors will build accountability and ownership, and contextualize it for their own surroundings. Unless the community is empowered to take care of itself, we are staring at an ever-growing shadow of mental distress which will last much longer than the pandemic."
