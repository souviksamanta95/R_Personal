And today they blocked his account, and when I called them to ask the reason they answered it saying ?the system has generated some error?.

Now it has come to be 16 days with re registered complain as HIGH PRIORITY ; it seems that they only say but don?t resolve your problem.

74,WORST  OLA ride in CHENNAI.,gaya3_303,4.8.20,1,"I have been traveling with Ola for years in many cities . 
In Chennai also , I have travelled a lot. 
As usual I booked Ola and I waited for the driver to come for 10min and once I sat inside the auto with my bags he asked me the otp which I shared . After that he asked me ola money or cash .. I said it?s Ola money . The second I said that he got so annoyed and gave me two choice leave the auto or cancel the ride and pay him the money. I told him I don?t have money that?s the reason why I booked Ola using Ola money. He said Cancel the ride and leave the auto .
(I am not a person from Tamil Nadu but i can understand the language..cannot speakthough) I said no .. so he canceled the ride by himself. The second he did that I called the customer care still sitting inside the auto because I was so mad ( this is the second time this happening to me .. where I called the customer care talked to them filed a complain and I was promised it won?t happen again ) The customer care executive talked to the driver for 5 min and then passed the phone to me and told me he canceled it .. please wait for few min I have booked another auto for you . I waited and. I received a call from another Ola driver few min after saying he reached the location but he was nowhere there. Two streets ahead he was . They put the wrong location I kept calling him again and again .
He was like I can?t find you cancel the booking .. I didn?t even cancel before that I received a message saying 15rs charged for canceling the Ola ride. I called the customer care again .. she said she will book again for me . I said no thank you . There is no pointing in going now .. I am 40 min late to reach where I wanted to go. 
This is the second time this happening to me. I was burst into tears when I was speaking with her. 
 I am a girl and I want you girls to be safe. 
Just keep this in mind when you depend on Ola at night or when you want to reach somewhere important atleast in Chennai . 
The drivers are craving for money they will force you to cancel the trip and promise you to take you to the same location for that same money .. please don?t fall for that and please don?t encourage that . 
If one person say yes they will expect that from each and every person which later on create incidents like this.",10/6/2016 0:00

In cities like Ranchi and Hyderabad Most of the OLA drivers cancel the cab and leave people stranded and many a times due to this I missed my flight as after speaking they cancel the trip. Once I left my costly Air shoe by mistake in OLA cab. The cab driver refused to give it back saying that there was no shoe in the Cab. I complained this to call center but I did not got any proper response to this. Need to be more professional and customer centric. Regards,",10/24/2016 0:00

129,"Ride cancellations, High fare ,  late booking , disgusting","Nithya Harshini , Hyderabad",4.8.18,1,"I have been using Ola in Hyderabad since many days. I'm facing too many problems. When I try to book a cab it takes minutes 10 mins to 30 mins to get a cab. After getting a cab it shows 5 mins away for pick up , where actually takes 15 mins to reach my place. It really wastes my time.

Second thing is , after booking a cab when I call the driver to update him , he asks me about my dropping locations and when I say the location he cancels because he don't want to drop at that location . 
And it takes again 20 mins to get a new cab. Very disgusting and time taking 
Once I faced a serious problem when I trusted ola. Once I booked a cab from my university campus which is in the outskirts of Hyderabad. It's around 9:30 PM and our campus is very big and no lights  around me and I was alone. I want to get back to home so I booked ola. Once after he came for my pick up, he asked me about my dropping location before entering OTP . When I told him about my drop location he cancelled my ride on the spot and asked me to get another cab.  I was worried and I'm a girl who's alone in that very big area and no street lights around me. How can he do that to a girl who's alone. And I booked another cab it came around 10:15 PM. 
After this incident I seriously lost trust on ola. 

And the third one,  cab drivers will cancel rides multiple times and we need to stand on the road for one hour 
Very disgusting in Hyderabad 

And Fare is too high compared to uber.
Finally I felt it's better to trust uber than ola. 

I hope you will take this into consideration and will fix the problem.",11/30/2016 0:00

As we had an interview at a fixed time and we could not reach in time. Over and above that we had to pay Rs. 500/- to driver and then pay Rs. 250/- to alternate vehicle. 
Driver gave an explanation that his brother has expired so he has to go back. Under any circumstances he could have dropped us at consulate which was hardly 4 km from where he dropped us. 
I expect Ola to refund the entire amount for the for the agony we had undergone. We are the senior citizens above 70 year and it was an terrible experience for us.

I find most OLA guys honest and straight-forward.  In fact, once I left my iPhone in an OLA auto and after calling the driver at 11pm ( as I had reached home), he  brought the phone back to my home.  I don?t have bargain or have long arduous discussions for cabs and autos anymore.  And that is a huge relief.  It is easy to contact the drivers and over time the app has become friendlier and more accurate.  I depend on OLA so much that I decided not to buy a car and rely on them for the last two years.  It has worked out well for both financially and from a convenience point of view.  Especially financially.  The constant complaint I heard from most drivers was that OLA was not being reimbursed in a timely fashion.  To help them I switched to cash and stopped using OLA money.  Life has been easier since.  Overall I a big fan of OLA inspite of technical hiccups of few location issues here and there and a few cancellations.  OLA has enhanced the quality of my life.  Thank You.",3/18/2017 0:00

Also the Ola app was taking through a longer route which was going to take approx 30 min more. But some how the google app on my phone was showing me a shorter and less taking time route which was saving me approx 30 minutes.

And wow, the cancellation charges? It?s okay, we understand that the driver had some sort of inconvenience, but what if, the driver was sitting at the opposite road, a minute away, from my same location, made me wait for 5 mins, then cut my calls, till I get fed up and cancel the ride, and that costs me 50 rupees...? The driver gets a fee from that too right? So they get around 20 rupees (if my math is right) for just sitting around and forcing the customers to cancel the ride. This is just not fair.

- night allowance (Rs. 100 if travel between 11pm - 6 am)
- additional Time fare (based on your ride chosen Rs. 150 to Rs. 200 for each extra hour - Users are penalized if there is traffic)
- Additional distance fare (based on your ride chosen, ranges from Rs. 11/km to Rs. 20/km, please check start km and end km inserted in driver dashboard)
- Travel insurance (Rs.49, which you need to explicitly turn off... And not vice versa)
- Toll charges and state tax over and above

Invariably you pay minimum of Rs. 500 more on the fare given in the app. 

Now if you have a rogue driver like I did, who added extra 77kms to my fare from Mumbai to Pune, then be ready for an extra high bill.

It's funny, coz when complaints are raised OLA customer care checks distance covered, time taken, etc. in the navigation system to resolve issues. Then why does the end fare not auto populate on the app, in the same manner? Why is the liberty given to drivers to add arbitrary kms in the dashboard?

They didn?t care that I paid double for an auto to reach the station on time and then missed the train also.

6 months back I was logged out of my account where I had around 2300 postpaid amount due. When I logged in to my account again using the same credentials, I saw no due amount in my account. It started afresh. 

Now Ola legal team is calling me for payment of the old amount. I am getting automated voice calls also for reminders as well as the link for making the payment. 

When I am opening the link for payment, it shows my current amount due not the old one. 

Please understand I am willing to pay but product is not letting me pay. I get calls everyday and no one legal team has tried to understand my problem. There is no way I can reach out to ola through app. Please I am struggling. Help me out.

In case of waiting or delay by the customer if charged is understood but then why the hell they give option to charge extra for heavy traffic??? 
Is it the mistake of the customer ?? Anyways when its peak time they always run at peak rate then why the hell they have to give such an option

I wish I could rate Ola zero.",11/12/2017 0:00
468,Worst service,dhhdhdcjkekdjfjdjeej,4.8.17,1,Why you guys have introduced cashless when Ola drivers are not okay with the scheme. I have been trying to book cab for 1.5 hrs but Ola driver calls me and asks if it?s cash or card. If it?s card/cashless they cancel it. How rude. 10 drivers did the same. This is ridiculous as it is getting delayed for us to travel office to struggle everyday like this. I would recommend Ola to get a policy signed by the drivers for cashless scheme. Or please take this feature off. And these days it?s difficult to even get a cab near by and on top drivers annoy us,11/13/2017 0:00

477,Why is the service going down?,A M JM,4.8.17,2,"I was a fan of Ola and was proud to use the service. Of late, the service is going down badly. Does Ola not pay the drivers/cab owners?
1) The driver asks whether the payment is cash or Ola money ? on saying Ola money, refuses to come and requests to cancel the booking.
2) If the ride is a short distance, cancels the ride.
3) After speaking initially, checks the destination and then keeps the line busy or does not answer so that you cancel the booking and it shows he is not the one who cancelled the booking.
If the above continues, Ola may soon be loosing a lot of customers and be out of business.
Better put your house in order, especially for payment mode.",11/22/2017 0:00
