Developer Nintendo stated the title’s recognition lifted income from April to June to 106.4bn yen (£770m) – greater than 5 instances greater than a yr in the past.
Sales present “no loss of momentum”, and different video games are additionally seeing robust demand, the Japanese agency added.
Animal Crossing’s success additionally boosted gross sales of its Switch gaming gadget.
Nintendo stated it bought 5.7 million Switch items within the quarter, up from 2.1 million a yr in the past. More than half of the consoles performed for the primary time within the quarter have been used for Animal Crossing, it added.
The positive factors got here regardless of lockdown-related manufacturing strains – Nintendo stated it had problem getting components.
The firm stated these points have eased, though a lag between manufacturing and supply means shortages proceed in lots of areas.
“We work hard to be able to deliver these products to consumers as quickly as possible,” Nintendo stated. Virtual island
The unique Animal Crossing was launched in 2001.
The newest title, Animal Crossing: New Horizon – during which gamers share an island with anthropomorphic creatures and full duties to earn cash – has been a runaway success throughout the pandemic, drawing in folks in search of escape and other ways to socialize.

Nintendo stated the 10.6 million Animal Crossing: New Horizons video games bought within the quarter outstripped different Nintendo video games gross sales by an element of 10.
In general gross sales, it trails solely the agency’s Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which has bought greater than 26 million copies since its launch in 2017.
Overall Nintendo gross sales have been 358.1bn yen within the quarter, greater than double final yr. Profits reached 106.4bn yen, in contrast with 16.6bn yen final yr.
“The numbers are insane,” business analyst Serkan Toto of Kantan Games said on Twitter .
But Nintendo has stated the gaming increase is prone to fade as lockdowns ease.
It didn’t change its full-year forecast for 200bn yen in income, which might be a decline from the 259bn yen it earned in its final monetary yr. "

"As the debate over social taboo on discussing mental health issues is growing and experts emphasise on correct usage of words when describing the act of suicide, is it correct for studios like Rocksteadys to title game Suicide Squads? Aug 8, 2020 03:21 IST Twitter
In terms of communication and marketing, an editor or a filmmaker understands the power of words and visuals used to entice the audience. They select texts and pictures which they think can pull in a maximum number of audience to their project. So far nothing wrong. But what about the usage of certain words, like suicide, that contentiously triggers a harmful attribute in people? Is it correct to use such words even then?
Rocksteady announces a new DC game: Suicide Squad
As the news about the new DC game by Rocksteady, Suicide Squad, was announced today, the term started to trend in upward of 40 thousand. Well, almost all the mention of the term in tweets were related to the game, it also spiked a concern about those with suicidal tendency and how the word ""Suicide Squad"" would impact such people.
There is much debate going on the issue of mental health and suicides after a spate of deaths of some well-known personalities in recent times. Celebrities like Kate Spade, chef Anthony Bourdain in the US last year, and actor Sushant Singh Rajput, his ex-manager Disha Salian, and two Bollywood and Bhojpuri actors dying by suicide recently steered the common consciousness of the society towards the topics like mental illness and suicide. — Rocksteady Studios (@RocksteadyGames) August 7, 2020
Growing discussion on mental health issues and suicide
The social taboo associated with depression and other mental illness has long distanced people with such issues to talk about it much less get the treatment for it, forcing them to suffer in isolation. It is only when they take the extreme step that people around them notice it. But now as the focus on mental health is gradually increasing, more research is also being done to figure out what triggers people to take such an extreme step.
What triggers people to take the extreme step
Though there could be many factors that can lead a person to think about taking his or her own life, experts say that it's mainly some sort of trigger that pushes them to take the extreme measure. Sushant Singh Rajput died by suicide on june 14 Instagram
It could be casually spoken words like ""kill me"", ""shoot me"", or gestures using hand like a gun, or words used in describing in the killing of oneself like ""committed suicide"", copy cat death , etc have been reported as triggers capable of pushing people to take extreme steps.
For example, according to one report, a Netflix show 13 Reasons Why , and an online game Blue Whale provoked many young boys and girls to take their life because the characters or the tasks in it pushed them to do such acts.
In these times, when people are spending more time online than interacting with real people, it is quite understandable that some of them would be heavily influenced by the online content and others might feel trapped there because in the real world they don't find enough encouragement to talk about their mental health issue.
Language matters
It is because of this, various health agencies have asked journalists to exercise caution when describing death by suicide instead of calling it ""committed suicide."" Netflix was forced to edit the controversial suicide scene from acclaimed teen drama, 13 Reasons Why after news of a rise in suicides among young people in the US. Courtesy: Netflix
Health experts explain that the word ""committed"" signifies the culpability of the person who took the step as if he had the option of doing otherwise. On the contrary, such a person takes that drastic step because he/she feels that that was the only resort. And the last thing we ever should do is to blame the person who was so in despair that he took the step.
As have been reported in several cases that till the last day victims' family or friend couldn't gauge that the person was going through mental health issues and after they take the extreme step, they came to know, it makes it incumbent upon us to practice precaution when using such words that can invariably cause distress to people suffering from suicidal thoughts.

"The latest gaming phone from the Taiwanese gadget giant blends powerful gaming experience with superior software performance and seamless multitasking
Asus has just introduced its third generation Republic of Gaming (RoG) smartphones -- the ROG Phone 3 -- in India. The timing of the launch seems pretty accurate, despite the difficult situation.
Several reports have confirmed that gaming activities, on mobile as well as with consoles, have picked up an unprecedented momentum during the Covid-19 pandemic as people have been forced to stay indoors during the lockdowns and practice mandatory social distancing protocols. A report from gaming analytics firm Newzoo shows the global video game market is forecast to be worth $159 billion in 2020, around four times box office revenues ($43 billion in 2019) and some three times the music industry revenues ($57 billion in 2019). The biggest market by revenue is Asia-Pacific with almost 50 per cent of the games market by value.
Priced ₹49,999, the ROG Phone 3 gaming smartphone sports an array of swashbuckling specs and features, starting with a 144 refresh rate, a super-powerful processor -- the 3.1 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus -- and a massive 6000 mAh battery. Since there aren’t many gaming smartphones around in this market and given that India has seen an uptick in gaming consumption and the segment is expected to grow faster than the global average growth, the arrival of the Asus ROG Phone 3 becomes particularly interesting to watch.
In case you haven’t heard yet, according to a FICCI-EY 2020 report on ‘Media and Entertainment’, India’s online gaming segment is likely to grow faster than the global segment. In 2019, the segment rose 40 per cent to Rs 6,500 crore and the report says it will continue to grow at a robust clip of 43 per cent to hit Rs 18,700 crore 2022. So the market is alive and clicking. Looks, display
The Asus ROG Phone 3 comes in a neat and compact package. The unboxing of the phone involves a nice augmented reality (AR) experience. After you’ve powered on the device, enter basic Android setup details and, then, you may scan the ROG totem on the side of the box cover. This action will trigger an AR experience and you’ll be asked to join the ROG Elite mission. This will allow you to be a part of the ROG Central social hub, which helps you avail a few brownies such as the ROG live wallpaper theme, Speed Machine. That’s indeed a nice touch to the whole unboxing experience, which is otherwise a routine exercise.
The phone is easy to hold thanks to the design and the back cover with enough grip. The Asus ROG phone comes with an 8GB RAM (LPDDR5/UFS3.1) which enables faster data transfer speeds. The in-built storage is of 128GB (which we had) and there is a 256GB variant as well. The device offers the popular NTFS support for external USB HDD. Files are transferred without much delay. The phone features an in-display fingerprint scanner which is fast and produces a nice animation when touched. A double-tap can bring it alive when the phone is locked.
The Asus ROG Phone 3 has a wide and large AMOLED display. The front panel measures 16.73 cm (6.59 inch) with a 19.5:9 ratio. It has a display resolution of 2340x1080 ( with a decent density of 391 pixels per inch). Asus has fitted the device with an impressive peer-beating 144 Hz refresh rate, which means you can play games with ease and without any lag. There is a 270Hz touch sampling rate (which means how fast the machine senses a touch on the screen) with 25ms touch latency and 18ms slide latency.
This is also one of the best faculties you can find in the market today. Very few devices, such as the new OnePlus 8, offer such fast touch sampling rates. This means you can play games fast and furious. In most mid-range phones touch latency becomes an issue right from the start and can be a real spoilsport. The Asus ROG Phone 3 offers a good response on that front.
The Asus ROG Phone 3 has a front panel supported by 2.5 D Corning Gorilla 6 Glass. Thanks to the 2.5 D factor, the glass panel has a nice contoured curvature at the edge. The capacitive touch panel with 10 points multi-touch also supports Glove touch. You can adjust the sensitivity in the settings. So if you are using the phone in the winter you may not have to compromise on the games. The HDR AMOLED display is true-to-life and does an impressive job while streaming ultra HD content. If you are a Netflix watcher this can easily be one of the best hand-held screen experiences you can get in this market today.
The display supports video playback of up to 1080 (60 FPS)K. It does play 4K or higher resolution video content but the output is capped at a maximum limit of 1080 (60 FPS). Which also means, if you are streaming video from YouTube, you won’t see resolution options beyond 1080 on the list. While playing ultra high definition content we have noticed that the display gets brighter and more saturated. Clearly, this is intended to give a better gaming experience but can be a bit of a nuisance while playing movies as some bright portions can bleed and blur. That said, the playback is simply seamless. Processor and audio
One of the major forces behind the seamless display experience is the processor that the Asus ROG Phone 3 carries within. It has the 3.1 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus SoC 5G Mobile Platform with 7nm, 64-bit octa-core processor
Backed by the graphic chip of Qualcomm Adreno 650. The 865+ 5G is built for delivering high-end mobile gaming and supports 5G, ultra-intuitive AI and faster WiFi. it improves power efficiency and overall performance boosting multitasking capabilities.
Clearly, the processor is the king here. Aided by the GPU, it helps the phone deliver extremely fast computing experience. Games run with impressive smoothness and you can keep opening tabs and yet the system does not lag in performance. We tested most popular games, such as Asphalt 9: Legends, PUBG Mobile, Raid: Shadow Legends, Sonic Dash 2, and so on. Everything ran nice and cosy.
The device has the power and volume controls on the right. The power button features a nice copper-red border that makes it stand apart. The device has another USB Type-C port and on the mid-left side which can be used when the device is on the horizontal mode. Asus has supplied a stylish back case with the quintessential ROG design, which protects the device from falls and scratches. The device is water-resistant but the phone doesn’t have an IP rating for water and dust protection, which is not a lot to demand given the price.
This is inarguably one of the best phones in this price range when it comes to audio. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed the audio experience from the built-in speakers -- the dual front-facing speakers with GameFX and Dirac HD Sound. The seven-magnet stereo speaker comes with dual NXP TFA9874 smart audio amplifier for less distorted sound. The phone has a high-resolution audio output of 192kHz/24-bit standard (using USB-C) that is four times better than CD quality. It features the ROG GameFX audio system for improved in-game audio experience while gaming. The New AudioWizard with multiple listening profiles has been tuned by audio technology company Dirac.
The phone has four microphones with Asus’s own noise reduction technology, which makes calls and audio recording more accurate. The quad-microphone set up gives recording of interviews and concerts a near-studio quality. Short filmmakers and podcast producers will surely be impressed. Premium camera experience
The Asus ROG carries a camera set up supported by a 64MP Sony IMX686 sensor with 0.8 µm pixel size and Quad Bayer filter (which was made popular by the likes of the Huawei P20 Pro) and F1.8 aperture for good landscape and profile shots. The rear camera unit also has a 13MP, 125˚ ultra-wide lens with F2.4 aperture. It has real-time distortion correction. The setup also has a 5MP macro lens with F2.0 aperture for portraits.
The camera output is quite impeccable. The camera clicks nice shots in daylight as well as under low-light. But it struggles a bit with autofocus, especially under low-light conditions. The photos have commendable honesty as they do not distort colours with unnecessary AI interventions. The camera features has the ability for motion-tracking, which can make it a good add-on for filmmakers and video journalists and vloggers. The camera auto-zooms while tracking the object. The motion-tracking capability is not very impressive in dimly lit environments but in daylight, it is a charm.
Another reason why short filmmakers will find the Asus ROG Phone 3 a useful companion is its ability to shoot videos in 8K and 4K HDR. The phone doesn’t let you shoot in low HD or below. The available options are in 8K (30 fps, 7680 x 4320), 4K HDR (3840 X 2160, 60 fps) and FULL HD (60 fps). The videos are of professional quality thanks to the impressive stabilisation faculties of the phone. You can shoot in HEVC mode for low file size and high-quality video. The shooter has good image stabilisation for motion video (4K at 120 fps; 1080p at 240/120 fps and 720p at 480 fps).
The front shooter set up has a 24MP lens with Quad Bayer technology, having an aperture of F2.0. It can shoot videos in FULL HD 1080p (30/60 fps) and 720p (30 fps). You can also take stills while recording video. The selfies are not doctored but we felt a little extra default saturation could have been better. With selfies, people generally expect a little exaggeration and true-to-life images are not really in vogue. That said, the image quality is of studio quality and can be used for making high-quality prints. Battery, a disappointment
A major blemish with the Asus ROG Phone 3 is the battery performance. Despite sporting a massive 6000 mAh battery, the phone drains out easily after 5-8 hours of normal use (surfing, video playback and moderate gaming). Ideally, such a massive battery should equip the device to last longer -- more than a day in ideal conditions, but the Asus ROG Phone 3 fares poorly on this front.
You’re advised to keep a powerbank aside if you are travelling and want to play games on the go. That this poor experience comes after having one of the most power-efficient processors in town is a tad disappointing. One reason could be the multiple gaming modes and options given which interfere with the performance of the phone unless the user takes time to sift through the options and disable them, which is a cumbersome process. The ASUS PowerMaster offers several options for battery optimisation, still, the battery performance is not up to the mark.
It is a fact that gaming phones are not bought just for playing games, especially in value-for-money-conscious markets such as India. Users expect such phones to excel at multitasking, offering impressive graphics performance and great battery life. On that count, the poor power efficiency of the phone is a bit worrisome.
That said the Asus ROG Phone 3 sticks to its famed legacy. It is a great phone that delivers a great seamless performance on all other fronts, from video to gaming to audio. No doubt, it can be a great companion not only for active gamers but also for vloggers, filmmakers and journalists.
Price: ₹49,999
Pros : Smooth, bright display; great processor, seamless performance, strong body, great camera, 8K video
Cons: Poor battery, too many confusing controls that can be a worry for non-gamers"

"HONG KONG: China on Saturday slammed the USA for imposing “barbarous” sanctions in response to Beijing’s crackdown in Hong Kong, capping a dramatic week of deteriorating relations between the world’s two largest economies. Within the hardest US motion on Hong Kong since China imposed a sweeping new safety regulation on the territory, Washington on Friday sanctioned a bunch of Chinese language and Hong Kong officers — together with town’s chief Carrie Lam. The transfer got here after President Donald Trump’s administration compelled Chinese language web giants TikTok and WeChat to finish all operations within the US, in a twin diplomatic-commercial offensive set to develop forward of the US presidential election in November. China on Saturday criticised the sanctions as “barbarous and impolite”. “The sick intentions of US politicians to help people who find themselves anti-China and messing up Hong Kong have been clearly revealed,” Beijing’s Liaison Workplace in Hong Kong stated in an announcement. The Treasury Division introduced it was freezing the US property of Chief Government Carrie Lam and 10 different senior officers, together with Luo Huining — the pinnacle of the Liaison Workplace. It accused the sanctioned people of being “straight liable for implementing Beijing’s insurance policies of suppression of freedom and democratic processes”. The transfer criminalises any US monetary transactions with the sanctioned officers. In a brief assertion, Luo stated he welcomed the blacklisting. “I’ve accomplished what I ought to do for the nation and for Hong Kong,” he stated. “I haven’t got a dime’s value in international property.”Beijing’s safety regulation was imposed in late June, following final 12 months’s large pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, sending a political chill by way of the semi-autonomous metropolis. Since then, authorities have postponed elections, citing the coronavirus pandemic, issued arrest warrants for six exiled pro-democracy activists and launched a crackdown on different activists. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo stated the safety regulation violated guarantees made by China forward of Hong Kong’s 1997 handover that town may preserve key freedoms and autonomy for 50 years. “At the moment’s actions ship a transparent message that the Hong Kong authorities’ actions are unacceptable,” Pompeo stated in an announcement. The US measures come three months forward of the November election through which Trump, who’s behind his rival Joe Biden, is campaigning laborious on an more and more strident anti-Beijing message. As public disapproval has grown for his dealing with of the pandemic, Trump has pivoted from his earlier concentrate on placing a commerce cope with China to blaming the nation for the coronavirus disaster. On Thursday, Trump made good on earlier threats in opposition to WeChat and TikTok — two Chinese language-owned apps with main audiences that US officers say pose a nationwide safety risk. In an govt order, Trump gave Individuals 45 days to cease doing enterprise with the platforms, successfully setting a deadline for a possible, under-pressure sale of TikTok to Microsoft. The transfer additionally threw into doubt the American operations of WeChat’s guardian agency, Tencent, a robust participant within the online game business and one of many world’s richest corporations. China condemned the transfer as “arbitrary political manipulation”. The brand new restrictions despatched Tencent shares tanking as a lot as 10 p.c at one level in Hong Kong commerce on Friday, wiping nearly $50 billion off its market capitalisation. Trump’s order claimed TikTok may very well be utilized by China to trace the places of federal staff, construct dossiers on folks for blackmail and conduct company espionage. TikTok has repeatedly denied sharing knowledge with Beijing. WeChat is a messaging, social media and digital cost platform and is reported to have greater than a billion customers, with many preferring it to electronic mail.

"Last week, a Gurugram businessman lost a huge sum of money to his son's addiction to online gaming. The Class X student had given UPI details of his account to an anonymous cyber crook who promised gaming currencies in return.
In July, a Punjab youth took his craze for mobile games to a different level by spending Rs 16 lakh from his father's account to buy virtual ammunition. Prior to that fraud, a motorbike mechanic lost Rs 50,000 after his 15-year-old son withdrew the money from his bank account to purchase a PUBG game controller as well as weapons.
If you are glued to online mobile gaming during coronavirus curbs, beware! Cybercriminals are now looking for targets on popular platforms and duping addicts with promises of gaming points, coins or virtual currency that players need to customise their gaming avatars.
The popularity for online gaming has surged during the pandemic and gained mainstream recognition. And hackers are making a killing by trapping and duping youngsters.
GAME ON!
Cyber crime investigators say Garena Free Fire and PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) and Fortnite are online multiplayer survival games and let players talk, chat and engage with random participants.
These games are usually free but have features to build the player's virtual character through points used to ""buy"" clothes, cars, and weapons.
In-game currencies can be used to get exclusive customisation, and complete missions and challenges or levels. All this could also be done by spending real money.
A Delhi Police official said as the number of gamers and the time spent on games have shot up drastically, cybercriminals have found a new breeding ground on online gaming platforms.
""Most victims are not coming forward as kids are involved in these frauds. Parents must keep banking details from children,"" he said.
EXPERT'S TAKE
Delhi-based cyber security expert Amit Dubey, while investigating a case, found thousands of fake websites, social media pages and chat groups that had people buying and selling gaming currencies.
""While tracking a case of missing money from the bank account of a south Delhi couple, I found the trail to Rajasthan. These criminals have made several Instagram and Facebook accounts where they post videos of latest tasks and customisation to lure young gamers. They offer in-game currencies at cheap prices but after gaining access to banking details they withdraw money and go underground.""
CRIME PUSH
In a case which was cracked by the Uttar Pradesh Police, it was found that the craze for being ahead of another gamer is pushing gaming enthusiasts to crime. A final year graduation student was arrested for duping gamers across India.
UP cops arrested another gamer for duping a resident of Rs 8 lakh. After a detailed analysis, it was found that the criminals targeted the boy who started spending more time on mobile gaming during the lockdown.
""The minor was addicted to online games. He was trapped while playing Free Fire. Criminals promised to give him a huge amount of virtual points and asked for his father's card and e-wallet details. Rs 8 lakh was withdrawn from the victim's account in installments,"" said senior UP Police official Triveni Singh.
The father did not know about these transactions. It was only when he went to the bank to update his passbook, he found the money missing.
After digital surveillance, a 20-year-old student from Agra was arrested. During interrogation, he confessed that he got drawn into gaming during the lockdown and duped gamers as he had to qualify different levels.
Singh warned that online gamers and their parents should be extra careful. ""These days, mobiles are connected to banking apps, e-wallets, social networking sites. One shouldn't play games with unknown people or give out personal or banking details,"" he said.
""Clicking on any link can also compromise the phone. This means one can fall victim to banking and social media frauds,"" Singh said.
TOUGH TO CRACK
A Delhi Police officer told Mail Today that it is difficult to track most accused because of the features of games. Gamers also use anonymous chatting applications.
Communications are encrypted and servers are based in foreign countries. However, not all purchases of in-game currencies are illegal. Experts claim there are forums and apps that provide legit payment systems but parents must ensure monitoring of these transactions.
The Jharkhand Police couldn't do much in the case of a Class 11 student who lost Rs 6.32 lakh while playing an online multiplayer game. He purchased ingame outfits and weapons. He told cops he needed a warrior's outfit and advanced weapons to go ahead and used his father's card. Officials said all transfers were done legally, so it was not a case of online fraud.
""Gaming has seen a huge growth and most gamers are teenagers or below 25. They are crazy about these games and go to the extent of spending real money to get virtual currencies. Parents must monitor these online payments,"" Dubey said.
The Indian online gaming industry is growing at an exponential rate and is expected to be worth $1.1 billion by 2021, according to Google-KMPG.
Online gaming has gained a strong foothold within the Indian entertainment industry. With a projected user base of more than 628 million gamers, this gives a whole new boost to the gaming ecosystem within the Indian economy.
With the number of gamers exponentially increasing every year, the gaming industry has become one of the most susceptible ones to cyber frauds.

Even before the Indian Premier League (IPL) tourney dates from September 19 - November 8, 2020 were confirmed, the platform had attracted intense industry attention. Despite the change in venue to Dubai, IPL signals first signs of recovery for several businesses. This road, however, is not without its challenges.Soon after IPL Chairman, Brijesh Patel, shared details for arguably India’s largest on-ground intellectual property, IPL has presented several concerns to organisers and franchise owners, especially on the monetisation front. What was once worth its weight in gold, now appears a penny-pincher on restrained advertising and sponsorship purses. IPL is not just going out of India, but it would also be observing social distancing norms. This will limit gate fee. In addition to this, there is dried up ad revenue in the market, and the public outrage against title sponsorship from Chinese brands such as Vivo has not helped. Also read: Patanjali Considering Bidding For IPL Title Sponsorship While this is present day ground reality, IPL has always boasted a certain strength, which cannot be undermined. This is perhaps a reason why the likes of homegrown FMCG brands such as Patanjali are at present mulling investing in the platform – a first of sorts for the marketer.Explaining the overall context, Shashi Sinha, CEO, IPG Mediabrands India explains, “IPL grabs the maximum eyeballs on broadcast and now even in newer channels. And hence, there will be many advertisers who would be willing to associate with the property. While this year has not chart out as expected, there will still be new advertisers that will keep the game going.” Sponsorship Erosion & Replacement With Vivo making its exit from the 13th edition of IPL, BCCI has been on a run for tuning in Rs 440 crore alone on its exit. Also, with the prevailing anti-China sentiment, the other sponsors’ participation (Paytm, Dream11, etc.), that made BCCI earn nearly Rs 170 crore, can pose challenges too. The exit of these sponsors will knock off nearly 20 per cent of the advertising revenue. Television broadcast, where the likes of Star India generated a significant amount of ad revenue from the Chinese company, will suffer a greater setback as Vivo advertised heavily on television. In the last edition of IPL, a jump of 20 per cent ad revenue to Rs 2200 crore on TV and digital platforms, was recorded.In this bear market, it appears extremely difficult for the broadcaster to even come close to this number and hence, will have to rework its revenue projection. On BCCI’s front, it will be a challenge to find a replacement at even half of the value that Vivo brought to the table. “These are tough times for all businesses and IPL is no different. However, it's only in difficult times that we see more innovations. At the same time, Indian market is very resilient and we have started seeing strong signs of a comeback already. Having said that, what will be important to see is whether IPL is able to drive marketing spends and provide the adequate RoI to the marketers. RoI will be the single most important parameter right now for all investments on the property,” asserts Mohit Joshi, MD – India, Havas Media Group. Goodbye Gate Fee There is no denying that absence of gate fee is an added roadblock, where franchises are losing out money anywhere between Rs 2.5-3.5 crore per match, which is around Rs 20-28 crore per season. Despite the distress, the franchises feel that having to see the IPL this year is godsend itself, considering the global pandemic. There is no greater joy than to come together and witness the game this year. All efforts are being put by the franchise owners and organisers to ensure that IPL 2020 is as successful as its previous editions, as the fate of a lot of domestic cricketers depends on it. “The biggest challenge is the gate fee. However, from BCCI’s point of view, it will not affect more than 15-20 per cent of the revenue,” explains Sinha. Will Advertisers Still Buy? With Vivo keeping the window open for its return next year, reports are that Amazon, Byju’s and Dream11 are potential replacements eyeing this opportunity for 2020. Industry experts appear optimistic about advertisers putting in money. While their budgets may not align with what was expected, it will eventually “work in the end”. The sentiment is positive also because IPL will mark the return of Live sports that had come to a complete halt in the wake of the pandemic. Joshi believes, “It is a great opportunity. After a long time, a live Indian sport is happening and will be telecast on media. Given this, there is significant excitement among marketers as well as viewers, who have been content starved for a long time. While there are constraints, I am hopeful that the season will go well and will see adequate client interest and revenues.” Jai Lala, COO of Zenith from Publicis Media, expresses that events such as these are generally calendared. Most advertisers reserve money for such big-ticket items. “IPL is a successful event for advertisers from different categories. With festive season and cricket around the same time, it is sure to be a lethal combination. It should be a great opportunity for categories like auto and mobile to reap the benefits.” Digital DominationConsidering there will be greater intake on IPL’s digital performance than the previous years and that the groundwork for that has already been done, given IPL is available on Star India platforms and Facebook, digital is sure to rule. Its growth has already been tremendous, owing to its viability, low-ticket value and distinctiveness. Sinha adds, “The power of digital has increased and advertisers will leverage sponsorships and find interesting ways to promote.” Joshi also expresses, “Digital will continue to attract much more interest of the marketers for two reasons --- more measurable return on investment (RoI) and lower entry cost compared to TV. More moment marketing opportunities would be created this year. Also, custom solutions like geo-targeting for the micro, small & medium enterprise segment would be important. Influencers and cricket celebrities will also play a key role this year in driving RoI and revenues for the brands.” Alternative Revenue Recourses While this sure is an out of the ordinary situation, the hope for a successful event remains in attendance. There may be pressure to find newer advertisers but the monetary loss can be readjusted with new sponsors on the table. Lala believes, “More than the Chinese sentiment, it is to do with the ask of the advertiser. IPL organisers can aim for the festive budgets of brands. They may have to reach out to more advertisers than the previous year, but I am optimistic that they will act as an alternative revenue stream.”Tough times create new opportunities. Already the rise in digital, even in the form of eSports, online gaming, native app integrations, virtual parallel properties and the likes are seen in positive light. As the industry also learns to collaborate more, there can also be a rise in integration between brands, ensuring more value for the consumer. Tags assigned to this article:"

"A 4G mobile data connection may have worked well for you till now. But now, with the unique work from home situation that we are in, there is load on mobile networks in residential areas, leading to even spottier coverage. At the 25 Years of Internet in India milestone, home broadband is gaining relevance. Last Updated: August 10, 2020, 2:53 PM IST Share this:
It had been on the menu for years. Home broadband was always on the cusp of major adoption. The promise was there. Reliable connectivity. Remote working. Online classes. Virtual meetings with your doctor. Smart gadgets and a full connected ecosystem at your home. Voice commands and smart speakers galore. Increased consumption of OTT services, including the likes of Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ Hotstar. It all held a lot of promise. Yet, it never really clicked into place. Till COVID, or the Coronavirus came along. It evolved into a pandemic, and companies including the ones who usually frowned upon anything else except seeing you glued to the workstations in office, suddenly rushed to send everyone home. Work from home (WFH) became the new buzzword. But, the condition was, you needed to be connected all the time. How is that possible? With a stable, reliable and fast enough internet line.
But this posed a problem for many. Home broadband was neglected in most homes all along. Seen as an expense that could be avoided. We have 4G hotspots, many said. While they were making do with their 3G and 4G connections for streaming Netflix and sending the occasional emails all this while, it just wouldn’t cut it when all your neighbours are also hooked up to the same mobile tower trying to get work done almost 9 to 10 hours a day. Dropped video calls with the boss, delayed submissions because “email attachments aren’t uploading” and “I have no network at home” doesn’t work when serious office work has to be replicated at home. Chances are, you are among the 19.02 million and growing number of home broadband users in India who are now relying on fast and reliable internet to get work done, have their child attend online classes, maybe even a quick spot of online gym in the morning and maybe once the madness of the day is over, some online gaming or binge watching to usher in the night.
One thing is very clear—a 4G mobile data connection may have worked well for you over the past few years. Netflix, web browsing, music streaming and instant messaging, all worked. But now it can’t. Mobile data speeds, particularly with the unique situation that we are in which sees extensive load on mobile networks in residential areas, will never mostly be unable to let you do a Zoom video meeting and simultaneously allow your child to attend an online class as well. Wired broadband has the potential for much faster speeds, wider bandwidth, lower ping rates and a much faster browsing and streaming experience overall. Interesting then, that this change comes as we celebrate the 25 years of internet in India, a milestone that perhaps is most significant in these times.
But what were the troubles all this while? The sluggish growth of wired broadband over the past few years can be blamed on multiple issues. Regulatory hurdles, lack of fiber infrastructure and the cost of services combined to keep services reigned in, to put it mildly, and kept consumers away. Often, the biggest players in the wired broadband space are also popular telecom companies. Airtel and Vodafone, for instance. The latter runs the You Broadband service. With the long drawn sagas over the 2G spectrum and 3G spectrum allocations and the costs associated with it for telcos at different points in the past decade and a bit more, it was perhaps to be expected that their investment capacity in the home broadband services would be limited. Which is why, for instance, for the longest time Airtel Broadband retained the DSL backbone for its home broadband services. The company did invest in upgrading ADSL lines to VDSL, which used a vectoring technology to offer better speeds. Yet, the challenges of the very basic technology meant distance covered, quality of cables and reliability of service was never really as good as expected. And speeds were limited too.
The reality, till at least mid-2018 was that if market leaders such as Airtel weren’t pushing wired broadband services aggressively. The competition, which included the likes of Spectranet (now called Spectra), ACT Broadband, Hathway at the time, DEN broadband at the time and others never really got around to actually competing. Perhaps the way we are seeing it happen now. A lot changed in 2018 when Reliance officially launched the JioFiber broadband service. We often credit Jio for changing the very landscape of mobility services in India with affordable prices and quality of 4G network coverage. The data suggests since JioFiber made its way into the home broadband market, rivals have had to really get their act together. The numbers prove it.
If we are to look at the Netflix ISP Speed Index data starting September 2018 when JioFiber officially rolled out, it retained the number one rank all the way till the end of April 2019 offering the fastest average speed on the network compared with all rivals. In fact, in September 2018, Reliance JioFiber logged into the rankings with prime time Netflix performance of 3.41Mbps. In comparison, Airtel broadband was still logging in at 2.98Mbps and Spectra clocked 3.07Mbps.
“India's fixed broadband market remains highly underdeveloped due to the dominance of the mobile platform and in turn by the uptake of mobile broadband. Fixed broadband penetration is expected to grow at a moderate rate over the next five years to 2024 from this very small base,” the ""India - Telecoms, Mobile and Broadband - Statistics and Analyses"" report by ResearchAndMarkets.com had said in September last year, noting the impact Jio Fiber was making in the wired broadband space.
Fast forward to January 2020, the last Netflix ISP Speed Index data logged before the pandemic, and we have proof of what competition does. Reliance JioFiber still leads the way with 3.63Mbps speeds, while Spectra logs in with 3.5Mbps and Airtel broadband, now Airtel Xstream fiber for many lucky users around the country as the fiber upgrade is happening rapidly, clocks in with 3.48Mbps. These numbers may not look a lot, but a consistent uptake of higher speed broadband plans at affordable prices across the network coupled with consistent delivery of the speed and services, has a huge bearing on this data.
The same trend is also confirmed by Ookla, the name behind the very popular Speedtest app. Their data says upgrades to the fiber networks on a much wider scale and increased adoption has meant India’s average broadband speeds increased to 34.07Mbps as of September last year, up 16.5% from the year earlier. As of June this year, Ookla says India is ranked 75th in the world in the fixed broadband stakes, with a download speed rating of 38.19Mbps and upload speed rated at 34.22Mbps—both significantly higher than 29.06Mbps and 25.85Mbps respectively, the year before.
Whichever way you look at it, one thing is clear—we are heading into a bright era where fast and reliable internet will potentially be the norm. Competition will force better quality of services across the board. Lots of value adds, such as Amazon Prime and Netflix subscriptions bundled too. At subscription prices that don’t hurt the wallet. Including for world class connections at 1Gbps speeds. This change is a part of the new definition of work from home, and is undoubtedly the very foundation of why you are able to work remotely. Maybe we need to love that humble internet wire that is snaking into our homes.
Editors' Note: This article is part of the 25 Years of Internet In India series, where try to capture how the state of mobile services, home broadband, services and content have evolved, particularly in the past few years. We try to understand what the internet means for us, be it for the new reality of work from home, for entertainment including all the Netflix binge watching, music streaming, online gaming and more.

Andrew Merkatz , President & CFO of Tapinator, commented on the Company's results, ""We are very pleased with the following accomplishments during the second quarter of 2020: We delivered our best bookings, net income, earnings per share, and adjusted EBITDA in Tapinator history, driven by our LiveOps which performed well throughout the quarter. We reported quarterly bookings * of approximately $1 .3mm, representing year-over-year growth of 60%. We reported, within our core Category Leading Apps business, quarterly bookings * of approximately $1 .0mm, representing year-over-year growth of 74%. We continued the significant cost control measures that we implemented in the first quarter of this year. These measures contributed to our achievement of quarterly net income of approximately $64,000 and adjusted EBITDA * of approximately $313,000 , which compare, respectively, to a net loss of approximately ($265,000) and adjusted EBITDA * of approximately $293,000 recorded in Q2 2019. We achieved adjusted EBITDA margin of 27% during the quarter, performance that we believe is indicative of the strong operating leverage inherent in our business.
The mobile game industry is expected to generate $100 billion in revenue in 2020, up from $86 billion in 2019, according to App Annie , the mobile data and analytics researcher. Based on the report, games are now 72% of all spending in the app stores. Mobile games saw 25% more spending than all other games combined in 2019. Mobile game spending was 2.4 times the spending for PC and Mac games, and 2.9 times spending for home game consoles in 2019. The growth rate of the social casino market, the subset of the market that Tapinator focuses on, is estimated at 5% over the next four years and is projected to reach $6.8 billion by 2023, according to market research firm Eilers & Krejcik. Tapinator has become a seasoned operator in this massive and lucrative market, and we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver strong growth and product leadership in the coming years.""
Ilya Nikolayev , CEO of Tapinator also commented, ""We are proud of Video Poker Classic and remain confident in the game's status as the best-in-class video poker product on mobile, from both a feature and quality perspective. We continue to enhance the game and, in Q2, we introduced Daily Goals and Rewards, a Stamp Card (Loyalty) System, Player Statistics and other features. Also, we launched additional LiveOps events and IAP offers, which we will continue to do on an ongoing basis. Later this quarter, we will be introducing a Tournaments feature, which we are very excited about. Every week, we will run two Tournaments, each for a different variant of video poker, and will reward virtual currency prizes to top leaderboard players. This feature is grounded in video poker tournaments that occur in a real money setting and, we believe, will be well received by both serious and casual players alike. Events are a proven mechanism to increase engagement and monetization within top grossing games and, we believe, will contribute meaningfully to an uptick in DAUs for Video Poker Classic .
Outside of Video Poker Classic , we would like to provide an update on two other products: SPEED - Heads Up Solitaire and our upcoming new social casino product. SPEED launched at the end of April, was featured by Apple and was well received by players with a 4.5 out of 5.0 review score. However, we believe that we need to achieve higher player lifetime values in order to scale the product from a paid marketing perspective. With the next version of the game, launched late last week, we have introduced in-depth systems for Chests, Premium Items, and a Secondary Currency. Collectively, we believe this will improve the game's ARPDAU and will allow us to bring more players into the game via paid marketing.
Finally, we will launch a new social casino product later this year. This product follows our overall thesis of targeting areas of the social casino space that are evergreen and proven outside of mobile yet are underrepresented within the major mobile platforms. This product targets an audience with similarities to our Video Poker Classic demographic and, accordingly, we believe that there will be cross promotion opportunities with our existing high-value userbase.""
Current Outlook It is too early to quantify and distinguish the long-term impact of the coronavirus pandemic for our business. In our games, we saw an increase in the number of downloads as well as user engagement and also saw an uptick in revenues in March and April. Despite this uptick, we believe the pandemic creates significant uncertainty regarding the longer term impact on consumer and advertising spending within mobile apps. Despite this uncertainty, we continue to have strong conviction regarding our Category Leading Apps business, and specifically our focus on social casino games. The strategic changes we implemented in 2017-2018, shifting from Rapid-Launch Games to Category Leading Apps , and the initiatives we began in 2019 to focus on LiveOps both continue to pay off. We have also seen positive results from the cost containment measures that we undertook during the first quarter of 2020 that we believe will continue to yield improved operating results moving forward.
While we are not providing financial guidance at this time, we continue to believe we are well positioned to again deliver strong company-wide revenue and bookings growth in 2020. We also anticipate recording significantly improved adjusted EBITDA and significantly narrowed net loss in 2020 as compared to 2019. Based on the Company's strong financial performance over the past two quarters, the repeatable nature of the Company's Category-Leading App revenues, its strong product portfolio, its significant operating leverage, and its attractive market positioning at the intersection of mobile entertainment and online casino style gaming, we continue to believe Tapinator is currently fundamentally and deeply undervalued. The Company's management and independent board of directors remain committed to working diligently and prudently on behalf of all of its shareholders to both grow and unlock this value in the second half of 2020 and beyond.
*Non-GAAP Financial Measures We have provided in this release the non-GAAP financial measures of bookings and adjusted EBITDA, as a supplement to the measures of Revenue and Operating Income, which are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). Management uses bookings and adjusted EBITDA internally in analyzing our financial results to assess operational performance. The presentation of bookings and adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to adjusted revenue, bookings and adjusted EBITDA in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.
We believe bookings and adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors and analysts because it allows for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics we use in making operating decisions and allows comparability to other businesses within the mobile gaming sector. Below, we have provided reconciliations between our historical bookings and adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below. Some limitations of bookings and adjusted EBITDA are as follows: Bookings does not reflect that we defer and recognize online game revenue over the estimated life of our durable virtual goods; Adjusted EBITDA does not include the impact of stock-based expense, impairment of previously capitalized software or intangible assets previously acquired, acquisition-related transaction expenses, one-time financing expenses, contingent consideration fair value adjustments and restructuring expense; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income tax expense; Adjusted EBITDA does not include other income or expense, which includes foreign exchange gains and losses and interest income or expense; Adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization of intangible assets and impairment of capitalized software. Although depreciation and amortization and impairment of capitalized software are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized or impaired may have to be replaced in the future; and Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently or not at all, which will reduce their usefulness as a comparative measure.
Because of these limitations, you should consider bookings and adjusted EBITDA along with other financial performance measures, including Revenue, Net Income (Loss), Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share, Cash Flow from Operations, Operating Income (Loss) and our other financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.

You can charge the laptop using the bundled adapter or even use a portable USB adapter you might be using for other devices. The Wi-Fi chip onboard supports the new 802.11ax standard (popularly called WiFi 6). This enables the Zephyrus to achieve very high data transfer speeds wirelessly. This is handy when you update your laptop or download the latest games from the web. The new technology helps maintain low latency, so online gaming is like playing on a local network. Even the power button on the laptop has a fingerprint scanner built into it that helps unlock your laptop.

The ASUS Zephyrus G14 is designed to handle cooling a lot better, not just for regular use, but in the long run. The fans and vents inside ensure perfect cooling of the components, but also stop the accumulation of dust and dirt that could heat up the laptop. The design is created smartly, so your laptop doesn’t weigh like a tank. The Zephyrus G14 weighs a meagre 1.7kg, nothing, compared to some of the other gaming laptops in the market.

On June 29th the Indian Government banned 59 Chinese apps as a response to China’s incursions into Indian Territory. Popular apps including ByteDance’s video-sharing app TikTok, Alibaba’s UC Browser and Xiaomi’s Mi Community app were restricted access to the huge 500 million internet consumer base in the country.
The move was followed by another ban that was imposed in the recent weeks on about 47 apps which mostly contained clones, or simply different versions, of the already banned apps. Now recently, the government has added 15 Chinese apps to the list of banned apps. These apps include photo editor AirBrush, video tool MeiPai and camera editor BoXxCAM among others. The Mi Browser Pro that came inbuilt with Xiaomi, Redmi and Poco smartphones has also been added in the list of apps that were banned in their latest move.
On this recent development by the Indian Government Mr. Ravi Mittal, Founder of the popular dating app QuackQuack that recently crossed 10 million Indian users commented “Suspension of Chinese apps which are a security risk to our country is a welcome move. There are 100s of more Chinese apps on the Play Store which are cannibalizing the Indian market and need to go. These include a lot of Chinese duplicates and low quality apps as well. However, this is a welcome start.
The Indian start-up ecosystem has some very good apps and can easily fill the void. We have to reduce dependency on Chinese apps and it is encouraging that we as Indians are going all out to support apps developed in India”
Durga Dash, Co-founder & CEO of a booming fashion & lifestyle brand in the country- Styched also shared his views on the move taken by the Indian Government “The ban on Chinese apps in the Indian consumer market has created a void – from a supply viewpoint at least. While consumers were used to apps like TikTok and Shein, their appetite to consume products and services online has only increased post pandemic ;and this is what Indian cos need to truly leverage. The void should be studied from a user experience viewpoint and be highly customer-oriented.
From a fashion viewpoint, void has only grown larger and newer models like on-demand production are needed. I believe Styched is in a unique position to cater to the needs of fashion millennials. With thousands of curated designs for both womenswear and menswear, largest fan merchandising and new age collections, Styched is already becoming a great option in filling up the fashion void for customers”
Showing his dedicated support to the government’s action Varun Mahna, CEO & Founder of PokerDangal, an online gaming platform said “A reiterate step like this in favor of our Nation’s sovereignty is a masterstroke I must say, India again won its spurs as one of the independent nations. We can finally say now that India is moving quickly towards being a developed nation, and brave steps like these, show how strong we are on the abstraction of ‘MAKE IN INDIA.’ Like I said earlier, abolishing Chinese applications will not only preserve our nation’s security and youth development but will also allow capable Indian growing platforms like ours’ to come forward and show their true potential.
Honestly, we are obliged to our government and believe that Indians will now prioritize native platforms over foreign ones, which will enable us to showcase our creativity, talent, and strong motives to serve the society in a better way. I can’t say about others, but PokerDangal and our entire team appreciates the ban of Chinese apps and is inclined to contribute our pleasing services more delightfully in respect of the progressing movement ‘MAKE IN INDIA’”.

LAS VEGAS, Aug. 11, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- Golden Matrix Group Inc. (OTC: GMGI), a developer and licenser of online gaming platforms, systems and gaming content, today said it achieved revenues of $1,045,000 in the second fiscal (July 31) quarter, the company’s first million dollar quarter and its eighth consecutive quarter of profitability.
The company also said its player base increased to 3.3 million registered users during the quarter, and that 20 new operators are currently being added to its existing 369 operator client base.
Golden Matrix revenues are derived primarily from licensing fees received from gaming operators located in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region and integrated with the company’s state-of-the-art GM-X platform. “We are thrilled to have reached this milestone of our first million-dollar quarter,” said Golden Matrix CEO Brian Goodman, “but it represents more than just exceeding an important revenue goal. We believe it indicates and reinforces an upward trend in quarterly revenues supported by our growing number of active users who can enjoy mobile gaming in a secure online environment. Going forward, we expect the company’s market share in the APAC region to continue to grow; and the company is now positioned to expand operations globally and enter new gaming-related markets, which will significantly increase revenues and profitability later in 2020 and beyond.”Golden Matrix said it plans to release second fiscal quarter financial results on or before the end of tis month.

"NEW DELHI: The MSMEs will take at least 7-8 months to recover from the impact of COVID-19 pandemic , and the recovery rate of an enterprise will depend on factors like its rate of digitisation and the sector in which it is operating, Global Chief Economist at Dun & Bradstreet Arun Singh said on Tuesday.
The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) contribute 29 per cent to the country's GDP. The sector is among the worst hit by the pandemic.
Addressing a webinar, Singh said the recovery time of an MSME will be tied to the sector in which it is operational.
According to him, sectors like online gaming, telecommunications and e-education operating in the digital space are witnessing a positive impact by leveraging opportunities arising from the pandemic.
On the other hand, traditional sectors like food, drugs, pharmaceutical, ITes (IT enabled services), banking, retail, automotive, real estate and jewellery are witnessing moderate to high to severe impact.
The recovery of these sectors will take six months to more than a year, said the Global Chief Economist at D&B.
Sectors like logistics and warehousing, metals, media and entertainment will also take up to one year to recover and return to February 2020 levels, he added.
""It will take at least 7-8 months for an average MSME to recover,"" Singh said."
