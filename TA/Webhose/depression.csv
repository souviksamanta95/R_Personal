The pandemic COVID-19 has caused an immense disaster throughout the world. Coronavirus cases continue to surge worldwide. Ephemeral loss of taste, smell, or anosmia is the foremost neurological indications, and one of the earliest and most often reported symptoms of coronavirus. Studies have shown that it predicts the infection better than other well-known symptoms (such as fever and cough), but the underlying mechanisms of the loss of taste, smell, or anosmia in COVID-19 patients are unclear.
Now , in another development related to coronavirus symptoms, an international team of researchers found that there is no protein in the taste buds that the COVID-19 virus uses to enter host tissues.
In other words , researchers have identified the types of olfactory cells most vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 disease (the virus that causes Corona ).
Surprisingly , sensory neuron cells that can identify and transmit the sense of odor to the brain are not among the cell types that are vulnerable.
According to experts on July 24 , the research team discovered that olfactory sensory neurons don’t express the encoded gene for the ACE2 receptor protein that SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter human cells. In contrast, ACE2 is expressed in cells that produce metabolic and structural supports for olfactory sensory neurons and certain vascular cell and stem cell populations.
These findings indicate that infections of non-neuronal cell types may be the cause of loss of taste, smell, or anosmia in coronavirus patients , and help to better understand the progression of the diseases.
Sandeep Robert Datta , an author and associate professor of neurobiology at the HMS Blavatnik Institute , stated that our findings show that the pandemic coronavirus does not directly infect neurons but changes the patient’s sense of taste and smell by affecting the function of supporting cells.
Datta further said : this means that in most cases, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is unlikely to permanently disable the olfactory neural circuit and cause persistent anosmia. This condition is related to various psychological and social health problems, especially anxiety and depression.
Besides this , the scientists analyzed the oral cells of the mice and concluded that the loss of odors reported by many COVID-19 patients may be due to inflammation caused by the disease rather than directly caused by viral contamination.
According to the study published in the journal ACS Pharmacology and translational science , although the ACE2 receptor protein used by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to enter the host tissues, is enhanced in cells that give the tongue a bumpy surface, they cannot be detected in the taste buds’ cells.
Researchers , including those from the Georgia University in the United States , also unveiled that other viruses that influence the taste, including influenza viruses, may infect different tongue cell types, adding that these viruses can cause infections by invading precise cells in the body. In the process of reproduction, these cells are often damaged or killed.
Although previous studies have recognized the symptoms of coronavirus, it has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells through ACE2 receptors on the surface of certain cells (including the surface of the human tongue), but recent studies have shown that this protein was not expressed specifically in taste bud cells. The mice were used as model organisms to study and express this protein specifically in taste bud cells.
Moreover , the mouse versions of ACE2 is not susceptive to SARS-CoV-2 disease, scientists asserted that considering where ACE2 is expressed in mice could help explain what happens when people are infected and lose their sense of taste or smell.
When they examined data on mouse buccal cells at three developmental stages, the researchers found ACE2 in infant mice , but not in fetuses. According to the researchers , former studies on humans did not focus on oral cells, which suggests that ACE2 can be expressed in the early stages of the fetus and then again at a later stage.
They speculated that the fetus may have different susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection at various stages, and added that more extra work is needed to determine the timing and location of human ACE2 expression.
Therefore , the olfactory system that enables humans and other animals to smell is actually a significant way to decode chemical information. When someone sniffs, molecules flow up from the nose to the olfactory epithelium, a small piece of tissue behind the nasal cavity.
These molecules attach to olfactory sensory neurons and then burst out signals through the axon, which passes through the skull and transmits the information to the brain, which records these molecules, like coffee, leather, or rotting lettuce.
In addition to this , according to emerging data, most COVID-19 patients experience a certain degree of anosmia, which in most cases is temporary. The analysis of electronic health records shows that as compared with patients without COVID-19 , patients with COVID-19 are 28 times more likely to have the odor disappear, while the probability of fever, cough or breathing difficulties is only 2.3 to 2.7 times higher.
Some studies have shown that the loss of taste, smell, or anosmia in COVID-19 patients is different from the sense of taste or smell caused by other viral infections.
For example , COVID-19 patients usually recover their sense of taste or smell within a few weeks, which is faster than months of recovering from anosmia caused by other viral infections that are known to directly damage many parts of the olfactory sensory neurons.
Furthermore , many viruses can cause temporary loss of taste or smell by triggering upper respiratory problems. However, some COVID-19 patients experienced anosmia without any nasal congestion.
The authors said these data together indicate that the loss of taste, smell, or anosmia associated with COVID-19 may be caused by the temporary loss of support cells function in the olfactory epithelium, which indirectly leads to changes in olfactory sensory neurons.
However , we do not fully know what these changes are yet, Datta said. Sertoli cell or a cell of the olfactory epithelium are largely ignored. It seems that we need to pay attention to them, just as we are more aware of glial cells’ vital role play in the brain."
"The only way to keep physically and mentally fit is by consuming the right amount of all food groups
After a year of struggling to shed the six kilos she’d gained during pregnancy, Jhanvi Sharma decided there was only thing to do: Cut carbs out of her diet. Sharma, who started her diet in February this year, shed four kilos before the lockdown came into effect, but the fi rst-time mum found herself exhausted and unable to keep up with the demands of motherhood.
“I felt tired all the time and I was cranky and irritable. It also caused huge problems in my family life,” says the 32-year-old Khar resident. Ironically, in a bid to be supportive, her husband, too, started on the same diet plan, but it didn’t help that he, too, seemed “more stressed and angry all the time”. While Sharma put her mood swings down to a hormonal imbalance, she assumed her husband’s state of mind had to do with pressures at work. A friend intervened and suggested they begin their days with 10 minutes of meditation and scrap their diet altogether, “and it worked wonders”, according to Sharma.
The truth about carbs
Jhanvi’s experience doesn’t surprise health experts, who — ever since the high-fat/low-carb ketogenic diet rose to popularity — have been shouting themselves hoarse trying to point out that carbohydrates are essential foods, too. The nutrient is the primary source for energy and helps fuel the muscles of your organs. Besides, as psychiatrist Dr Chinmay Kulkarni highlights, diets that are low in carbs may worsen mental health conditions.
“A carbohydrate deficient diet can deplete the levels of tryptophan, thereby reducing the levels of serotonin, which is important for normal mental health,” says Dr Kulkarni, pointing out that reduced levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin causes mental illnesses like depression and anxiety. “Some studies have also found that eliminating carbs can cause memory disturbances. This happens because carbohydrates are an important energy source for the brain.”
Sport scientist and nutritionist Krushmi Chheda adds, “Each nutrient has a function to play in your health, so it’s vital to consume a diet that delivers a balance of nutrients.” Using an analogy to explain how it works, nutritionist Madhuri Ruia, founder of Integym at Colaba, says: “The macronutrients — proteins , fats and carbs — are interdependent, much like different departments of an organisation, each of which serves its own function. Striking off any single department would make it harder for the others and impair the functioning of the organisation as a whole.” On the other hand, relying too heavily on a single nutrient, like protein, is also unhealthy.
The protein obsession
That there’s a market for ‘protein-tracking apps’ offers some clue of how popular this nutrient has become. But Chheda says, “If you eat only a high protein diet, you compromise its benefits. Protein will then be utilised to do the work of other nutrients. Fats and carbohydrates, if supplied in the diet in sufficient amounts to meet caloric needs, will spare protein, so it can be used for protein metabolism .” Besides, excessive protein in the form of calories can be converted and stored as fat, she says.
This is also why people load up on protein drinks when the aim is to gain weight. This is dangerous because the extra protein one consumes may impose a metabolic burden on the kidneys and liver. Additionally, Sharma says that it’s not possible to stick to a diet that focuses on a single food group any more than it’s possible to sustain a plan that requires eliminating any food group. Sharing that it’s harder for people who want to gain weight to meet their goals than for those who want to shed a few pounds, Sharma says, “To gain weight, you need expert guidance to make sure you’re doing it the right way, and getting all the nutrients.”
For her own part, Sharma has increased her intake of dense, complex carbs, “as my level of physical activity has increased with all the housework that has to be done, in the absence of domestic workers”. “If you omit carbs, you omit fibre, which regulates insulin and blood sugar levels. Your energy level would fall and proteins would then be utilised for the work carbs do,” she says, adding that when one consumes a balanced diet, protein helps fuel muscle mass, which supports metabolism. “It also keeps the immune system strong.”
Dr Kulkarni warns that the excessive intake of proteins can also be detrimental to mental health. “Frequent mood swings have been seen with people on a very high protein diet,” he says, adding that this can also cause frequent headaches.
Take the middle road
Proteins and carbs aren’t, however, the only foods that diets are centred around. Some involve sharply cutting the intake of salt or chugging down excessive amounts of water to curb hunger and flush out the body. Chheda, who played competitive tennis at the international level for 11 years before she studied nutrition and launched Core in Santacruz, knows that athletes and actors often stop consuming salt in a bid to get lean quickly.
“Salt helps regulate homeostasis — the balance of fluid in your body. That constant movement of intracellular and extracellular water is how you produce energy, so if sodium levels go down, your energy levels fall. And if sodium levels fluctuate too much, it can even cause a seizure or disorientation,” says Chheda, adding that it may also inhibit muscles from contracting properly.
Overhydrating can also be problematic. It can cause a drop in electrolyte levels, leaving you with headaches, nausea and muscle weakness. Chheda offers a rule of thumb: “To calculate the minimum amount of water you need, work out how much you weigh in pounds and divide it by half. That’s the figure in ounces,” she says. “Remember, that all the nutrients work in sync,” she says, prescribing a good combination of carbs, proteins, fat and fibre, “the quantities of which depend on your basal metabolic rate, levels of physical activity and how much energy you use in a day.”
The macronutrients — proteins, fats and carbs — work together and are interdependent, much like different departments of an organisation

"Privacy lawsuit against tabloid
Meghan , the Duchess of Sussex, won a court battle on Wednesday to keep the names of five of her friends private for the time being as part of her legal action against a British tabloid, PA Media reported.
Meghan, wife of Queen Elizabeth ’s grandson Prince Harry , is suing Associated Newspapers over articles in its Mail on Sunday paper that included parts of a handwritten letter she had sent to her estranged father, Thomas Markle , in August 2018. As part of its defence, the paper argues that it had published the letter in response to an article in the US magazine People which was based on anonymous interviews with five of Meghan's friends.

Siddharth Pithani reveals Sushant Singh Rajput had a habit of tearing diary pages
Late actor Sushant Singh Rajput roommate Siddhart Pithani was the first to see his dead body as he was living with the actor. Pithani -- who first made headlines for his email to Mumbai Police, claiming that Rajput's kin was 'pressurizing' him - has now opened up about receiving death treats by furious netizens and also addressed several allegations. In his recent interview, he spoke about the allegations that the pages of Sushant SIngh Rajput's dairy were missing.
Siddharth Pithani told Times Now that the actor 'had a habit of tearing diary pages himself'. ""The diaries that Sushant had shared about, he had written about scientists and geniuses, and he wanted to invite them to his house and make a nice video so people could learn from them,” he revealed. Responding to allegations, Siddharth said, “Sushant had a habit of tearing pages if he didn’t like what he’d written. I’m sure people will find missing pages in more books also.""
For the unversed, during the probe, Mumbai Police had recovered five personal diaries from Rajput's Bandra residence, which were reviewed to find any leads to ascertain his cause of depression and trigger for suicide. A few pages from the diary were rumoured to be missing. Sushant Singh Rajput death: Police recovers five personal diaries from actor's apartment
In another interview, Siddharth Pithani revealed that he has filed a police complaint in Hyderabad, regarding the alleged death threats and online abuse.
Meanwhile, Rhea Chakraborty, accused of abetting suicide of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday in connection with the money laundering case lodged by it.
The ED has also summoned for questioning Shruti Modi, who is Chakraborty's business manager, and Rajput's friend and roommate Siddharth Pithani in connection with the money laundering probe stemming from a complaint filed by his father with the Bihar Police in connection with his death, officials said.
They said the two are accused in their case and their statements will be recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) once they appear on their scheduled dates for Friday and Saturday respectively.
Pithani is stated to be out of Mumbai at present and he has said in various news channel interviews that he was present in the Bandra flat on June 14 when the 34-year-old actor hanged himself.
The IT professional, stated to be living with Rajput for about an year, had earlier recorded his statement with the Mumbai Police as part of their accidental death report (ADR) probe in the case.
Rajput, 34, was found hanging from the ceiling of his apartment in suburban Bandra in Mumbai on June 14. Mumbai Police had registered an Accidental Death Report (ADR) and an investigation is underway in the case. Till now, the Mumbai Police have recorded statements of more than 55 people, including Rajput's sisters, Chakraborty and some other film personalities.

"UPDATED: August 7, 2020 18:16 IST Disha Salian's death has been linked to that of Sushant Singh Rajput.
India Today has exclusively accessed WhatsApp texts from one of Disha Salian's close friends, that reveal exactly what happened on the night she died. Disha had reportedly jumped off or fallen off a 14th-floor building in Malad, Mumbai on June 9. Disha's death is being linked to that of Sushant Singh Rajput's, who died of suicide on June 14. Disha also briefly worked as Sushant's manager.
As per the messages accessed by India Today, Disha Salian was partying with her friends and fiancee, and after consuming a considerably large amount of alcohol, she felt depressed and said no one cares for anyone anymore. A friend present at the party asked Disha to stop being a party pooper and after that, she went inside her bedroom and locked herself in. Sometime later when she didn't answer the knocks, her fiancee and friends pushed opened the door and found that she had fallen off the balcony and ran downstairs. She was alive when the group went downstairs and they rushed her to the hospital where she was declared dead. This detail is part of a message shared by Disha's close friend who had spoken to one of the friends present at the party. This message has also been shared on the college friends WhatsApp group which Disha was a part of, and upon verification, the police found the facts to be true.
Disha Salian, former manager working for a talent management company, who also handled late actor Sushant Singh Rajput's account, died on June 9 after reportedly jumping off or accidentally falling from the 14th-floor residence of her fiancee in Malad. Five days after Disha's death, Sushant died of suicide.
Since then, there have been multiple theories connecting the two deaths, with some conspiracy theories claiming that the two had been murdered. BJP MP Narayan Rane even went on record and claimed that Disha had been ""raped and then murdered"" and there were some big names from Maharashtra politics and Bollywood involved. Rane went to claim that Disha had informed Sushant Singh Rajput about her rape and since then, he was being threatened by the same group which eventually went for a party at Sushant's house on June 13, and the next day, he was found dead.
A message shared by Disha's close friend with India Today tells a completely different story and rubbishes the claims of Rane and also other such theories.
The message reads:
""Her fiancee Rohan, Himanshu from college and two of her childhood best friends Neel & Deep along with Neel’s new girlfriend were there.
This is Rohan and Disha’s house that Rohan bought because they were going to get married and move in.
She was having fam issues and usual fights with Rohan but nothing way too major with him.
4 days ago she moved to Malad to this house.
Yesterday everyone came over and they got drinking.
She had a lot to drink and started crying saying things like “nobody cares about each other anymore” and stuff.
Friends say she would get emo after drinking often.
She called my friend Jeevita at 8 pm and spoke casually about post lockdown plans.
At midnight, she video called with her friend in the UK and said the same things.
Then she was crying and Himanshu was like kya party pooper ban rahi hai types.
Next thing you know, she’s gone to the room, locked the door and turned the tap on.
They presumed she’s throwing up.
Then they kept calling out to her and no response so they broke in and she wasn’t there.
Himanshu and Deep looked down and saw what happened and ran. By the watchman already called the cops.
Her heart was still beating but the body was dismantled (14th floor) and they picked her up and put her in Deep’s car and went to 3 hospitals all refused to take.
4th hospital allowed and declared dead.
Now Covid tests are on - if negative, after a post-mortem they’ll give the body to the family.
Meanwhile, all 4 boys are under custody but at home with cops.
Rohan is getting badgered.
Disha’s family is livid because they knew of their fights and stuff.
And everyone is in disbelief because nobody would imagine she would.""
Disha's parents who have been distraught since her death are presently even more in pain as media theories and politicians have been claiming that she was raped, then murdered and that she was pregnant. The family is being hounded, and following which they have written to Mumbai police seeking action against the politicians, media and social media influencers involved in running these conspiracy theories.
Mumbai police also said that Sushant had met Disha only once in the past and when she died he had messaged her name to his lawyer asking who she was as he didn't remember her. Her death being and she being linked to Sushant had added to Sushant's depression as it happened a day after Rhea left his residence and went back to her residence."

"Health is a major concern nowadays and being healthy is the most important fact. Mental health or mental well-being of employees is a crucial determinant in their overall health and that poor mental health and stressors at the workplace can be a contributory factor to a range of physical illnesses like depression, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular conditions, amongst others.
Besides, poor mental health can also lead to burn-out amongst employees, seriously affecting their ability to contribute meaningfully in both their personal and professional lives.
Mental health problems have an impact on employers and businesses directly through increased absenteeism, negative impact on productivity and profits, as well as an increase in costs to deal with the issue. Besides, they impact employee morale adversely.
There are various ways to address the concern: 1. Ensuring a healthy work -life balance life: Employees should not only talk about work-life balance but also ensure that they are adhering to it. Study reveals Japan and India have notoriously long working hours. Encouraging healthy eating habits and regular exercise can go a long way in helping employees adopt a better lifestyle. Companies for this can encourage various health programmes and work from the facility to adhere to the above.
2. Making the work place a mental harassment free zone: It is very important for the organisation to not only to keep the organisation sexual harassment-free but also on the need to make the workplace mental harassment-free. This can only be done once the employee thing about the employee by not bombarding the employee with the unnecessary target but to ensure they are reaching home on time.
3. Keeping one on one session: Employers need to keep a one to one session with the employee to understand the need and give the required the space to the employee so that they can discuss the concern.
4. Be realistic while demanding performance Unrealistic expectations, especially in the time of corporate reorganizations, which, sometimes, puts unhealthy and unreasonable pressures on the employee, can be a tremendous source of stress and suffering. Increased workload, extremely long work hours, and intense pressure to perform at peak levels all the time for the same pay can leave an employee physically and emotionally drained.
Excessive travel and too much time away from family also contribute to an employee's stressors.
5. Conducting sessions mental health and wellbeing with experts: We all know that when one's mind is peaceful; they think clearly and perform better. The right guidance through online sessions can help employees to a large extent. Another aspect is awareness of mental health which is the fundamental element to protect and enhance your well-being.
This awareness is majorly lacking and workshops on creating awareness will go a long way to help employees identify what they need to focus on and help them work towards achieving their goal.
6. Avoiding micro management: Employers need to understand these days that they should avoid micromanagement. Unnecessary involvement in the employees' space could lead to stress and mental issue. Micromanagement creates ruckus in the life of the employees especially in the post-Covid-19 world, mental health will be a major part of overall workforce health.
Promoting employee wellness and offering a nurturing environment will undoubtedly prove to be mutually beneficial.
Mental health and wellness of employees require undivided attention. When companies offer importance to the overall wellbeing of their employees, there will be a significant difference in the overall progress of the organisation.
7. Take care of each other: Lastly, the very important things over and above all are take care of yourself. The stress of job loss and unemployment can take a toll on your well-being and leave you more vulnerable to mental health problems. Just believe in yourself and trust that this time shall too pass.

"Centre Asks To Be Part Of Rhea Chakraborty Petition Centre Asks To Be Part Of Rhea Chakraborty Petition An FIR filed by Sushant Singh Rajput’s father named Rhea Chakraborty and her relatives.
New Delhi:
The central government on Friday approached the Supreme Court requesting to be heard in the petition filed by actor Rhea Chakraborty challenging the case against her in Bihar in the death of her boyfriend Sushant Singh Rajput.
The central government said it wants to be heard in the case in the interest of justice and it will not cause prejudice to any party in the transfer petition. Legal experts said the centre’s request is standard procedure and may have been prompted by the tussle between Maharashtra and Bihar over the case.
Rhea Chakraborty had challenged the complaint filed against her in Patna following Sushant Singh Rajput’s death on June 14. The Bollywood actor’s death was suicide, says the Mumbai Police, which is investigating whether he was driven by clinical depression and ugly rivalries in the film industry.
The Patna Police launched a new investigation after Sushant Singh Rajput’s father filed a complaint blaming Rhea Chakraborty, for his suicide and accusing her of taking his money and harassing him. Later, the case was transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).
Earlier in the day, the Bihar government accused the Mumbai police of helping Rhea Chakraborty and obstructing its investigation, in a statement to the Supreme Court.
Rhea Chakraborty has given no proof that the Patna police is “biased against her” beyond “general and bald allegations”, said the lawyer for Bihar, arguing against the actor’s petition to transfer the case filed by Sushant Singh Rajput’s family in Patna to Maharashtra.
Even though its case has been transferred to the CBI, the Bihar government told the Supreme Court that Patna police does have jurisdiction in the case because the complaint is by Sushant Singh Rajput’s father KK Singh, who is from Patna.
At this point, three agencies – the Mumbai Police, the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate – have been tasked with investigating Sushant Singh Rajput’s death and events leading up to it.
The Enforcement Directorate, which investigates financial crimes, had filed a separate money laundering case last week over “suspicious transactions” in connection with the Bollywood actor’s death based on the complaint filed with the Bihar Police. Ms Chakraborty appeared before the agency on Friday to give her statement.
Rhea Chakraborty, who has denied all charges made by Mr Singh and had herself asked for a CBI probe last month, reversed her position on Thursday saying that the agency should stay away till the Supreme Court has given its verdict on the issue.
An investigation by the CBI at this point will be “totally illegal and beyond any known legal principles, affecting the Federal Structure of the Nation,” she said in a statement."

"Overthinkers are people who are buried in their own obsessive thoughts. Imagine being in a large maze where each turn leads into an even deeper and knottier tangle of catastrophic, distressing events - that is what it feels like to them when they think about the issues that confront them.
Everyone overthinks their lives or options every once in a while. Some people, however, can&apos;t stop the wheels and halt their train of thoughts.
This inner monologue has two components: ruminating and worrying.
According to the late Susan Nolen-Hoeksema, a professor of psychology at Yale University, ruminating involves replaying a problem over and over in your mind. We ruminate by obsessing over our thoughts and thinking repetitively about various aspects of a past situation.
It usually involves regret, self-loathing and self-blaming. Rumination is associated with the development of depression, anxiety and eating disorders.
People prone to such patterns of thought may, for example, overanalyze every single detail of a relationship that breaks up. They often blame themselves for what has happened and are overcome with regret, with typical thoughts being:
- I should have been more patient and more supportive.
- I have lost the most perfect partner ever.
- No one will love me again.
Worrying is wanting to predict the future. It involves negative thoughts about things that might and might not happen.
- They&apos;ll not like me in the interview; they&apos;ll not give me the job.
- I haven&apos;t heard back from other employers. How long will I be unemployed?
These thoughts are energy-draining and distressing. They could happen to anyone under stress. But when you reach the point where your thoughts and worrying are preventing you from doing what you want to do - from living your life to the fullest - then you should take action.
Reuben Berger, a psychotherapist at the university hospital in the western German city of Bonn, recommends several practical steps that you could employ in your daily routine when you catch yourself worrying or ruminating.
One effective remedy, says Berger, is the thought-stopping technique.
""When the negative thoughts come or ruminations start, you say to yourself: &apos;Stop!,&apos;"" he says, adding that it is more effective when you actually say the word out loud.
He even recommends having a rubber band around your wrist to ping against yourself while saying the word. Adding a visual component by imagining a stop sign also makes the technique more powerful, he says.
The main idea here is conditioning yourself to stop the loop of worrying (making future predictions) or rumination (obsessing over past events).
Berger says the technique could take up to two weeks to take effect and that it needs to be practiced every day. ""Consistency is very important,"" he says.
Another way of dealing with negative thoughts often used in modern therapy is realizing that thoughts aren&apos;t facts, says Berger.
He says it is important when we think something to ask: Is that real? Did that really happen? What is the worst thing that could happen?
Flight anxiety is one example where untrue thoughts are accepted as facts. Although air travel is the safest way to get around, people suffering from fear of flying accept their thoughts and fears as reality, then act upon them by refusing to fly.
Berger also recommends the use of mindfulness techniques, in which attention is paid to experiences in the moment without judging them, as a way of reducing worrying.
""Mindfulness helps you to distance yourself from your thoughts and to be more present in the moment,"" he says.
Several studies have shown that mindfulness has a positive impact on reducing stress-related behaviors such as rumination and worrying, as focusing on the moment makes anxiety about other problems impossible.
Mindfulness can be practiced during routine activities by paying attention to your body and your surroundings. For instance, when you leave for work in the morning, you can focus on sensing the breeze, listen attentively to birds, feel the gravel under your feet and monitor your breath.
People plagued by obsessive thoughts do not always choose healthy ways like mindfulness to distract from them, however.
Dr. Edward Selby, a psychologist at Florida state university, has shown in a study that people try to avoid rumination by engaging in a range of uncontrolled behaviors, such as binge eating and substance abuse.
But he says that a much better way to overcome such distress is by distraction and shifting attention away from problems that are obsessing us.
There are many activities that can be used to distract from rumination, he says, and people should choose the one that works best for them. Here are some examples:
- Listen to music
- Read a book
- Take a hot shower
- Dance or exercise
- Talk to a friend (not about the problem)
- Watch a movie
- Mindfulness meditation
The way people perceive a situation largely influences their emotions and behavior. It is not the situation itself that determines how they feel, but rather the way they interpret it.
Reframing negative thoughts can lead to positive emotions and, subsequently, healthier behaviors - including a reduction in damaging overthinking and worrying.
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is currently a gold standard in psychotherapy. CBT aims to change the way people think and act. It largely involves challenging unhelpful beliefs or attitudes such as overgeneralization - thinking ""I always fail at public speaking"" when you have had one bad experience in front of an audience, for example - or ""catastrophization,"" i.e., imagining the worst possible outcome to a situation.
A psychotherapist can teach people how to implement such thought-changing techniques into their lives. Techniques vary depending on their issues and goals.
Try to find ways of avoiding worrying, rumination and overthinking that make you feel most comfortable.
Incorporating any routine in your life when you&apos;re stressed isn&apos;t an easy task, but you can do it! If you feel overwhelmed, you can always seek professional help.
If you are suffering from serious emotional strain or suicidal thoughts, do not hesitate to seek professional help. You can find information on where to find such help, no matter where you live in the world, at this website.

"Actress Anupama Pathak, who has worked in TV serials and Bhojpuri films, has committed suicide due to personal reasons. The incident took place on Sunday night when Anupama hanged herself on the noose. Before taking such a big step, Anupama has also left a suicide note in which she has given the reasons for hanging.
Actress Anupama Pathak used to live in a rented house in the MMRDA building near Thakur Mall, located on the Dahisar checkpoint in Mumbai. Before hanging himself on Sunday night, he left a suicide note in which he gave two reasons for taking this step. For the first reason, he wrote, &apos;A man named Manish Jha took my two-wheelers from me in the month of May during the lockdown. At that time, she was at her native residence. When I came back, Manish refused to return my motorcycle to me.
The second reason is written in the suicide note, &apos;I invested Rs 10,000 in a Wisdom production company at the behest of a friend. The company was supposed to refund me my money with interest in the month of December last year. But now that company is pretending to refund me my money. &apos; Not only this, but Anupama had also done a live session with her Facebook account before committing suicide, in which she has told all her troubles.
The police have registered a case based on a suicide note from actress Anupama Pathak&apos;s home. Senior PI of Kashimira Police Station Sanjay Hazare said, &apos;We are investigating this case. However, action will be taken against their culprits only when the investigation of all the facts is complete. Anupama Pathak has also raised her voice on social media in the alleged suicide case of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.
Kushal Punjabi, Sejal Sharma, Sushant Singh Rajput, Sameer Sharma, and Manmeet Grewal have already been involved in the frequent incidents of alleged suicide this year. In all of these, it has been said equally from the police living in depression.

"Peng’s team said that the recovered patients could only walk for 400 metres in six minutes, unlike their healthy peers who could cover a distance of 500 metres in the same time.
A team of doctors in China has claimed that lungs of 90 per cent of Covid-19 patients who recovered in Wuhan, the city where the outbreak of the disease was first reported, are still damaged.
The team is led by Peng Zhiyong, the director of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. It has been conducting follow-up visits with ‘100 recovered patients’ since April.
The findings of the research have been startling. Peng’s team said that the recovered patients could only walk for 400 metres in six minutes, unlike their healthy peers who could cover a distance of 500 metres in the same time. This is based on the walking test with the patients.
The first phase of this one-year programme finished in July. The average age of the patients in the study was 59.
The researchers also said that some recovered patients have to rely on oxygen machines even three months after being discharged from the hospital, researchers from another team said. This study was conducted by Liang Tengxiao, a doctor from the Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, on patients above the age of 65.
The results of their study also showed that antibodies against the novel coronavirus in 10 per cent of the 100 patients have disappeared, according to reports published in Chinese news outlets. The 100 patients’ immune systems have not fully recovered, it further said, adding that the patients suffered from depression and a sense of stigma.
The coronavirus disease first started from Wuhan , in China’s Hubei province, late last year and spread across the globe. Hubei province has reported a total of 68,138 confirmed Covid-19 cases till now. The disease has claimed 4,512 lives in the province, according to the official data.
China, meanwhile, reported 37 new coronavirus cases in the mainland as of Thursday, the country’s health authority said on Friday.
Of the new cases, 10 were imported infections involving travellers from overseas compared with seven such cases reported a day earlier, the National Health Commission said in a statement published through its official account on social media platform Weibo.
There were also 14 new asymptomatic cases, down from 20 a day earlier.
Total number of infections in mainland China now stand at 84,565, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634.

"MUMBAI : Television actor Sameer Sharma, best known for his roles in “ Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi "" and “ Left Right Left "", was found dead in his home in suburban Malad where he lived alone, police said on Thursday.
The 44-year-old was found hanging from the fan of the kitchen on Wednesday night, police officials said. He may have been dead for two days before he was found, they said.
""We have not found any suicide note at the spot. It seems to be suicide case. It is suspected that he hanged himself two days back. We have sent the body for an autopsy,"" Malad police station's senior inspector George Fernandes said.
Sharma, who also worked in serials such as “ Kahaani Ghar Ghar Ki "", “ Yeh Rishtey Hain Pyar Ke "" and “W o Rehne Wali Mehlon Ki "", lived in a rented flat in Chincholi Bunder locality in Malad (West).
His body was discovered by the building's watchman, who peeped through the kitchen window and saw him hanging. He then alerted members of the society who informed the police.
Police rushed to the spot and took Sharma to a hospital where doctors declared him brought dead, another official said.
Efforts were on to get in touch with the family of the actor, who had been living alone since February, he said.
Based on primary information, an Accidental Death Report (ADR) has been registered, Fernandes said, adding that further investigations are underway.
On July 27, Sharma posted his last words on Instagram with a poem on death and dreams.
“I built my pyre and slept on it and with my fire it was lit. And all that was me I burned in it. I killed my dream to wake up from it. Now my dream is gone,"" he wrote on his page.
After that, he posted some photographs but no written content. His bio on Instagram reads “Actor. Writer. Poet"" and mostly has shots of beaches and videos of him driving to scenic places.
Sharma’s death comes at a time the entertainment industry is reeling from the shock of the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput, who was found hanging at his apartment in suburban Bandra on June 14. Rajput’s death, which will now be investigated by the CBI, exposed many fault lines in the industry.
""Depression is a lonely disease,"" Sharma had posted after Rajput’s death.
“Biopolar Disorder, Depression, and Schizophrenia etc. do you know or understand what that means or feels like? No you don’t, unless you’ve been through it yourself. And anybody who hasn’t, will never ever be able to understand what that feels like,"" he wrote on July 22.
Bollywood star Sidharth Malhotra, who worked with Sharma in “ Hasee toh Phasee "", condoled the actor’s death.
Sharing a picture with Sharma from the film, Malhotra wrote, “Really sad and unfortunate #RIPSameerSharma.""
Actor Varun Dhawan also shared a picture on his Instagram stories and wrote “#RIPSameerSharma"".
On June 9, Rajput’s former manager Disha Salian jumped from a high-rise building. The month earlier, on May 15, TV actor Manmeet Grewal had hanged himself at his Mumbai home.

"An FIR filed by Sushant Singh Rajput’s father named Rhea Chakraborty and her relatives.
New Delhi:
The central government on Friday approached the Supreme Court requesting to be heard in the petition filed by actor Rhea Chakraborty challenging the case filed against her in Bihar in the death of her boyfriend Sushant Singh Rajput.
The central government said it wants to be heard in the case in the interest of justice and it will not cause prejudice to any party in the transfer petition.
Rhea Chakraborty has challenged the complaint filed against her in Patna following Sushant Singh Rajput’s death on June 14. The Bollywood actor’s death was suicide, says the Mumbai police, which is investigating whether he was driven by clinical depression and ugly rivalries in the film industry.
The Patna Police launched a new investigation after Sushant Singh Rajput’s father filed a complaint blaming Rhea Chakraborty, for his suicide and accusing her of taking his money and harassing him. Later, the case was transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation."

Covid-19 researchers hope monoclonal antibody treatments are a bridge to vaccine:
There are a few dozen studies under way in the global push to develop monoclonal antibody therapies—drugs known as “mAbs” that can both prevent and fight infection. They are made by screening hundreds of thousands of antibodies found in the blood of recovered patients, isolating the most potent and engineering them into supercharged disease fighters. Monoclonal antibodies have been used to fight illnesses for decades. The first mAbs treatment was licensed in the US in 1986 to help kidney transplant patients accept their new organ. The method has since been modified to treat cancers and autoimmune disorders. Read more here

"Home / Lifestyle / Health / Body weight has surprising, alarming impact on brain function Body weight has surprising, alarming impact on brain function By Tanveer Published: 7th August 2020 7:15 pm IST As a person’s weight goes up, all regions of the brain go down in activity and blood flow, according to a new brain imaging study.
The new study was published in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease .
One of the largest studies linking obesity with brain dysfunction, scientists analyzed over 35,000 functional neuroimaging scans using single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) from more than 17,000 individuals to measure blood flow and brain activity. Low cerebral blood flow is the #1 brain imaging predictor that a person will develop Alzheimer’s disease. It is also associated with depression, ADHD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury, addiction, suicide, and other conditions.
“This study shows that being overweight or obese seriously impacts brain activity and increases the risk for Alzheimer’s disease as well as many other psychiatric and cognitive conditions,” explained Daniel G. Amen, MD, the study’s lead author and founder of Amen Clinics, one of the leading brain-centered mental health clinics in the United States.
Striking patterns of progressively reduced blood flow were found in virtually all regions of the brain across categories of underweight, normal weight, overweight, obesity, and morbid obesity. These were noted while participants were in a resting state as well as while performing a concentration task. In particular, brain areas noted to be vulnerable to Alzheimer’s disease, the temporal and parietal lobes, hippocampus, posterior cingulate gyrus, and precuneus, were found to have reduced blood flow along the spectrum of weight classification from normal weight to overweight, obese, and morbidly obese.
Considering the latest statistics showing that 72% of Americans are overweight of whom 42% are obese, this is distressing news for America’s mental and cognitive health.
Commenting on this study, George Perry, PhD, Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease and Semmes Foundation Distinguished University Chair in Neurobiology at The University of Texas at San Antonio, stated, “Acceptance that Alzheimer’s disease is a lifestyle disease, little different from other age-related diseases, that is the sum of a lifetime is the most important breakthrough of the decade. Dr. Amen and collaborators provide compelling evidence that obesity alters blood supply to the brain to shrink the brain and promote Alzheimer’s disease. This is a major advance because it directly demonstrates how the brain responds to our body.”
This study highlights the need to address obesity as a target for interventions designed to improve brain function, be they Alzheimer disease prevention initiatives or attempts to optimize cognition in younger populations. Such work will be crucial in improving outcomes across all age groups.
Although the results of this study are deeply concerning, there is hope. Dr. Amen added, “One of the most important lessons we have learned through 30 years of performing functional brain imaging studies is that brains can be improved when you put them in a healing environment by adopting brain-healthy habits, such as a healthy calorie-smart diet and regular exercise.” Categories"
"Sushant Singh Rajput’s death is becoming a dark mystery every day. Media galleries are filled with new detail every other minute and new theories are published. Earlier, it was considered that Sushant has committed suicide, however, with new details, the case is unfolding and some big names are said to be indulged in the case. The nation and Sushant’s family is sure that his death was a murder and Sushant’s girlfriend, Rhea Chakraborty has become the prime suspect after the FIR was filed against her. (Also Read: Sushant's Sister, Shweta Shares A Cryptic Post As His GF, Rhea Reaches ED Office, Ex Ankita Reacts )
The Bihar government had requested for CBI enquiry, and on August 5, 2020, SC had accepted the plea. The Centre's senior second-most law officer, Tushar Mehta had informed, ""Union of India has in principle accepted the request by Bihar to have a CBI probe. Notification regarding the same will be issued by the end of day today."" Along with this, Rhea’s plea for interim protection was declined. Now, with ED summoning the accused, we have some new theories coming into the light.
In a conversation with Pinkvilla, Sushant Singh Rajput’s ex-assistant, Ankit Acharya, who used to stay with him 24*7 before Rhea entered his life had made some shocking revelations. When asked about June 14, 2020, the day of Sushant’s death, he shared that Sushant’s servant is claiming that the late actor had woken up at 6, had his breakfast, juice and then locked himself in his room. He quipped that it was their responsibility to check on Sushant if he was inside for this long. They should have knocked and banged on the door. If the door was not opening, they should have broken it. Why did they wait for the key maker? As long as he was working with him, he had never seen Sushant close his room to sleep. He believes that it is not a suicide, but murder. His neck had marks, which doesn’t look like suicide. He believes that the marks are from Sushant’s dog, Fudge’s belt. It is a clear murder.
When asked how Sushant’s life changed after Rhea Chakraborty had entered his life, he shared that Sushant used to be a lively person. He lived with him and his cook, Ashok, and the three had a brotherly bond. Sushant used to play virtual reality and used to ask them to accompany him. He used to have fun with them, and was a big devotee of Lord Shiva. He was attached with his mother, and used to wake up looking at her picture. He was not depressed before Rhea and was always happy. However, when Rhea had entered his life, his life had changed entirely. The smile on his face was gone. He used to be in depression, and always engaged in his deep thoughts.
Rhea Chakraborty has also been accused of money laundering from Sushant’s account, and today she has visited the ED’s office for the same. Sushant's father, KK Singh had filed an FIR against her for abetment to suicide, mental and financial harassment, he had alleged that Rs 15 Crore was transferred to accounts that weren't in any way connected to Sushant. Sushant Singh Rajput's creative manager, who was also his flat mate, Siddharth Pithani in an interview with Times Now had given details about Rhea Chakraborty's expenditure on Sushant's money. (Don't Miss: Ranbir Kapoor Teases Elder Sister, Riddhima Kapoor Sahni In Their Unseen Raksha Bandhan Pictures )
According to Pithani, he had then talked about the same with Sushant and the latter had confronted Rhea about her expenses. Although, Pithani said he has no idea what conversation they had in private. However, after confronting Rhea, Sushant had told Pithani not to worry about those things anymore as Rhea takes care of everything at home, Pithani alleged. Pithani had also told the news channel, ""Sushant told me that I don't have to worry about the expenses & Rhea was taking care of everything.""

"Reuters The US Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday said the US added 1.8 million jobs in July. That exceeded the 1.5 million payroll additions expected by economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The report marks the third straight month of job gains since the US saw record payroll losses in April as part of the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic . The BLS also said the US unemployment rate was 10.2% in July, down from 11.1% in June. The US economy added jobs for a third straight month in July, reflecting the nation's attempts to reopen and claw back from the devastating coronavirus recession.
American businesses added 1.8 million nonfarm payrolls during the month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . That exceeded the 1.5 million payroll additions expected by economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
The US unemployment rate came in at 10.2%, the BLS said, lower than the 10.6% expected by economists. It was also down from 11.1% in May.

The data comes amid a crucial time as the US tries to recover from the damage caused by the virus, which triggered the worst recession since the Great Depression. Recent spikes in coronavirus cases have forced some states to pause or roll back their reopening plans, threatening a swift recovery. Advertisement Inside the numbers Employment ticked up across most industries and sectors, according to the Friday report. The biggest gain was in leisure and hospitality, which rose by 529,000 in July, accounting for one-third of the gain in payrolls during the month.
Retail trade, professional and business services, healthcare, social assistance, manufacturing, and transportation jobs also gained in July.

The BLS noted that generally, public-sector education employment falls in July before seasonal adjustments. Because these layoffs and furloughs happened earlier in the year because of the coronavirus pandemic, the July increases in local government education and state education were ""unusually large,"" according to the report.
The number of people on temporary layoff decreased by 1.3 million in July and is now 9.2 million, roughly half the April level. Permanent job losses were little changed from the previous month, standing at 2.9 million in July. The level of permanent job losses is important to watch, as those who are not on temporary layoff have a harder time finding new employment.
Signs of weakness remain Even with the better-than-expected data, there are some lingering signs of weakness in the labor market. US employment still remains nearly 13 million below the February level, according to the report. Advertisement Further, numerous indicators throughout July flashed warning signs that the economic recovery had lost momentum.

"THE PLIGHT OF SMALL BUSINESSES & HOW TO STOP IT What's Hot August 7, 2020 / 13 min read The International Monetary Fund (IMF) describes the decline of the global economy as the worst since the Great Depression, with it shrinking by 3% this year. Guest author With the global pandemic not going away anytime soon and in some parts of the world rearing it ’ s ugly head again, some businesses are finding it hard to see light at the end of the tunnel, and even closing up shop for good. It is truly saddening and shocking that five months ago prosperous businesses have seen their profits evaporate with rent and other costs looming large.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) describes the decline of the global economy as the worst since the Great Depression, with it shrinking by 3% this year. The deep sense of uncertainty is having an affect in all corners of the world, and retailers face challenges never seen before. How consumers will react remains to be seen, and talk of the “ new normal ” will look like still cannot be ascertained.
It ’ s a hard time for almost all brick and mortar, mom and pop stores globally - but even in the darkest of times there is still opportunity to be found. A global Visa study finds 67% of small businesses and 78% of consumers have adopted new behaviours to adjust to COVID-19.
While this is promising news, it will take even more adjusting and new ideas to keep most small businesses afloat in these turbulent times.
One interesting change from the pandemic that needs to be recognised is how it has led many new consumer segments to use online avenues as a means of shopping. As the older and more vulnerable generations as well as all the others move online, merchants also have the need to build a more inclusive payments system that makes it simple for all online users, new or experienced, to access and pay for goods and services.
One angle some businesses may not have investigated and considered fully is the potential of dropshipping … Sure, e-commerce would have been brought up and their online presence bolstered, but just how far have small business owners looked into having re-sellers try to market and sell their products on their behalf, through social media and other means?
A true Dropshipping solution for SMEs could open up a whole new avenue of desperately sought after profits that some businesses may not have thought possible during these difficult times. Social commerce is being brought to the fore faster than anticipated, with Asian markets already way ahead of the curve.
Having multiple resellers market their products on their behalf and create orders out of thin air seems too good to be true, but it ’ s not the case: online spend has reached $77 billion more than expected in June 2020
The solution is simple, open your product line and eCommerce capabilities up to a hugely growing world of online sales. The time is now, consumers are shopping online more than ever before due to the pandemic, just look at Amazon ’ s last quarter revenue of $88.91 billion
I will leave you with this: retailers that are ready to find new methods of marketing and selling their goods (i.e. dropshipping + social/e -commerce), provide consumers with an experience that minimises time-in-store and proximity to other people will be in a good position for the (already in motion) changes in consumer behaviour. That’s why we launched our startup ( dropshyp.com ) in 2019, to support SMEs and small brands as well as to also help entrepreneurs and drop-shippers with quality suppliers and products to source from. With Dropshyp, we not only are helping SMEs increase their international presence but also to drop-shipping to start a business within minutes.

"As COVID-19 continues to keep us at home and disrupt our daily routines, business remains strong for nutritional therapist Ayana Habtemariam, MSW, RDN, LDN . In late spring, she began to see an uptick in clients who share similar concerns: a fixation with weight gain and body image issues that had intensified while self-isolating. “People just aren’t feeling good in their bodies,” she says. “It’s not really based on how they look—what they see in the mirror might not have even changed that much—but that’s how it manifests.”
Habtemariam isn’t the only expert whose clients are experiencing dissatisfaction with their bodies right now. Many mental health pros report that this year’s lockdowns are triggering new and existing body image issues for many people. Negative body image involves “ feelings of shame, anxiety, and self-consciousness ,” according to the National Eating Disorders Association—and people who experience it are more likely to suffer from depression, low self-esteem, and eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia. An unhealthy body image can manifest in a number of ways, says marriage and family therapist Kim Campbell, MFT. “[A person] can be looking in the mirror and wishing that their stomach was flatter or there are more extreme behaviors like overexercising , disordered eating, pinching themselves all the time, weighing themselves all the time, measuring themselves all the time.”
In many cases, body image issues are connected to a feeling of powerlessness. It makes sense, then, that people are experiencing them in the COVID-19 era when every aspect of daily life has been thrown into disarray. “We have lost a lot of control over our work, financial security, home life, social environment, personal relationships, and more—things that in the past may have been stable and reliable,” says Nina Vasan, MD, MBA , the chief medical officer of mental health studio Real . “We don’t know what tomorrow is going to look like, we don’t know what next month is going to look like, and all the uncertainty is very distressing.”
Some people react to uncertainty by turning their attention to one of the things they feel they can control: their bodies. This was the case for 26-year-old Emily*, who’s been managing the stress of rescheduling her wedding multiple times—and pressing pause on the heavy weight training workouts that have helped her in her eating disorder recovery—after COVID-19 hit. “Before quarantine, I was probably feeling the best I ever had about my body,” she says. “But since then, I’ve started to see a lot of things pretty negatively all over again. It’s a lot of [thinking] I have to work out today, I can’t rest, I don’t deserve to eat this . I’ve had a lot of time to just sit and overanalyze myself in the mirror. It was kind of scary because it was like, I’ve been here before and I’m back into the same thought patterns .” Related Stories {{ truncate(post.title, 18) }}
Reactions like Emily’s aren’t unusual, according to Amanda Fialk , PhD, LCSW, LICSW, partner and chief of clinical services at mental health treatment community The Dorm . “When your mood is down, you’re spending a lot of time inside, you’re isolating, your self-esteem tends to plummet. You feel worse about yourself, generally speaking,” she says.
The strange new reality of stay-at-home life can also contribute to negative body image. Some people are spending more time on social media, while others are staring at their likeness on video conferences all day . These two forms of screen time have been triggering for 33-year-old writer Amanda Gist , who is in recovery from bulimia and binge eating disorder. “I had thoughts surrounding how the ‘after’ body in the ‘quarantine 15’ memes looked like my body and it was what everyone was trying to avoid—my body was clearly unacceptable and God forbid anyone came out of quarantine looking like me,” she says. “I would get out of the shower and skip putting lotion on because I couldn’t stand to touch my body, so much shame and embarrassment returned. Also triggering has been the new commonality of Zoom calls and getting used to so much FaceTime. Seeing myself on camera in the corner brought on thoughts of how much weight I had gained due to binge eating disorder and throughout eating disorder recovery.”
For 27-year-old Geena*, who is also in recovery from an eating disorder, shopping at near-empty grocery stores in the early days of lockdown proved highly triggering. “When you have that extra stress of everybody in a mask and trying to get the food they want, I think that’s very much why those thoughts were creeping back in… like Don’t grab that, you can’t eat that ,” says Geena. “I left the store shaking the first couple of times we went. I had gotten to a point where my bad body image days were maybe once every other month, and with quarantine I was having the thoughts regularly.”
Danielle Payton, the 30-year-old co-founder of digital fitness platform Kuudose , was just getting familiar with a new low-FODMAP eating plan to help manage endometriosis symptoms when the pandemic hit. Once she started limiting her grocery store trips, she experienced a resurgence in the body dysmorphia that’s plagued her for years. “They told us we shouldn’t leave our houses for two weeks, and that’s when it started to get hard,” she says. “When I couldn’t go out to the grocery store, I was like, do I eat what’s in the house and not take a risk [of contracting COVID-19]… and then the next day I look in the mirror and I look six months pregnant because I have an endometriosis flare-up? When I have a flare-up [during the pandemic] it’s drastically worse because I don’t have the same resources.”
On top of these stressors, the more time we spend holed up at home, the fewer distractions we have, and the more easily our thoughts and emotions are amplified. “We may have been able to suppress those emotions pre-COVID, but there are so many things going on—protests, all of those things—and people are feeling a lot,” says Habtemariam. As a result, “they might be eating more and they might be beating themselves about that.”
Whatever the causes for increased body dissatisfaction during quarantine, there are plenty of therapist-approved ways to feel better. But the first step is to treat yourself with radical kindness. “A client of mine said to me, ‘There are so many things I could have done [during quarantine] if I wasn’t thinking about my body,’” says Habtemariam. “But you have to be gentle with yourself and understand that it’s okay.” Read on to learn how to navigate body image issues during COVID-19 quarantine. 1. Explore what’s behind any negative feelings towards your body
Negative body image isn’t always about the body itself—often, there are deeper feelings of unworthiness at play. If you find yourself having harsh thoughts about your body, take a minute and dig into why that might be. “Ask yourself, What is it that I’m really feeling here? What am I looking to prove or not prove to myself in this moment? Is it that I have value? Is it that I’m okay?” says Campbell. “The act of turning that critical lens on ourselves is just a defense against feeling those deeper feelings. If we can stop ourselves, get in touch with those feelings, and perhaps write about them instead of tearing ourselves apart, we’ll get some insight into what is really going on internally.” 2. Celebrate what makes your body powerful
Next time you feel negativity creeping in, Campbell suggests thinking about all of the cool things your body can do for you. Maybe your mind helps you write beautiful poetry, your legs carry you through thousands of steps a day, or your big heart makes you a great friend or dog mom. “When we’re in a negative mindset, we lose the perspective of the other things that are valuable about us,” says Campbell. “Everything gets reduced down to the size of our jeans, which is so diminishing and dismissive of the holistic creatures that we are.” If you have trouble being kind to yourself, Dr. Vasan and Habtemariam are both fans of the “best friend test”: Are you talking to yourself as kindly as you would if you were talking to your best friend? If not, make a point to do so going forward. 3. Limit social media consumption and focus on supportive communities for body image issues
In a recent survey conducted by behavioral health treatment facility FHE Health, 23 percent of American women said that social media has the greatest impact on how they feel about their bodies —a greater impact than traditional media or IRL relationships. If you’re feeling more down on your appearance than normal, consider that it could be linked to your scrolling habits. “The need for social comparison right now is quite great because we’re in this situation together and we want to see how other people are doing it,” says Campbell. “So, when we’re on Instagram and we see somebody who has the body type or the skin or the hair that we think we should have, then we turn a critical lens on ourselves.”
It doesn’t help that many of the messages on social media right now center around daily at-home workouts, home cooking, and avoiding the “quarantine 15.”“It creates a lot of pressure to measure up to an ideal that’s probably not even very attainable,” says Dr. Fialk. “And yet it feels like everybody else is doing it so why can’t I do it as well? It’s triggering old issues and it’s also instigating new ones.”
Of course, not all social media accounts feed negative body image. In fact, online communities can provide valuable support for those who feel alone in their body image concerns. “I think it’s helpful to cultivate an online or in-person community that you feel safe in—people who look like you or share the same beliefs as you when it comes to the body and people who accept all bodies for what they are,” says Habtemariam. “Until we can dismantle this oppressive system that demonizes certain bodies and puts certain bodies on a pedestal, we have to support each other.” 4. Check your attitudes toward food and exercise
Many of Habtemariam’s clients who suffer from anxiety— like so many of us during COVID-19 —have perfectionistic tendencies when it comes to their wellness habits. “What I usually see is people being hyper-fixated on doing things ‘the right way.’ They feel like if they aren’t doing the right things, their body image is going to suffer and it’s their fault,” she says.
This is why Dr. Fialk says it’s important to approach food and exercise from a place of non-judgment. “There’s a difference between saying ‘I want to exercise because it lifts my spirits’ and saying ‘I have to exercise because if I don’t, I’m worthless.’ It’s about perspective and reframing the way we look at it. You can set goals of wanting to exercise because it makes you feel good and also not beat yourself up if you’re not able to do it on a certain day.” Danielle chose early in the pandemic to stop wearing her fitness tracker, as she felt triggered by its constant urging to get up and move. “For a girl who has body dysmorphia, it is not going to be beneficial if it’s reminding me every hour how many calories I didn’t burn,” she says.
On the food front, Dr. Vasan says to avoid labeling any meal as “bad” or “good,” as this can create feelings of guilt. Instead, she says to pay attention to how your body is feeling and to feed yourself accordingly. “Find ways to comfort yourself that don’t include food,” she says. “But if you are eating more every now and then, let yourself enjoy it.” Habtemariam also suggests paying attention to when you’re not eating enough . “It’s really hard to deal with our emotions if we’re not nourished,” she says. “If you have to schedule times to eat and put a reminder on your phone, that’s okay. Just make sure you’re getting some form of nourishment throughout the day.” 5. Get back into a routine
Sorry to break it to you, but this tip requires a break from sweatpants, aka the official uniform of COVID-19. “There’s something that makes you feel better when you get up, brush your teeth, take a shower, put on some work clothes, and act as if [it’s a normal day],” says Dr. Fialk. “The more we sit around and fall into poor sleep-wake cycles, that generally adds to dissatisfaction with self.”
That said, remember to be kind to yourself if you fall off of your schedule for a few days and lose yourself in old Curb Your Enthusiasm episodes. “There’s no such thing as a perfect day, especially in the coronavirus world. We have to be really patient and gentle with ourselves because we’re all experiencing a trauma right now,” says Dr. Fialk. 6. Stay connected to loved ones
If you’re prone to ritualistic “checking” behaviors—looking at yourself in mirrors, weighing yourself, etc.—you may be tempted to do more of that while self-isolating. “The more time we spend isolating, the more time we spend in our own heads, and when you struggle with how you feel about your body, that isn’t always the best place to be,” says Dr. Fialk. As an antidote, she suggests scheduling regular virtual hang-outs with friends and family, doing things like virtual games , movie nights , or scavenger hunts.
And while you might not want to talk to everyone in your life about your body image concerns, Emily has found it helpful to share her feelings with those she trusts. “I talked to a friend who I didn’t know was struggling with the same issues and it helped me feel a little bit better,” she says. As it turned out, that friend was seeing a therapist and the conversation convinced Emily to start therapy, too. “Really rely on your community and don’t be afraid to be vulnerable when things go wrong,” she says. 7. Talk to a mental health professional about body image issues
With the rise of teletherapy , it’s easier than ever to get professional help for mental health concerns, body image issues included. “You don’t have to wait until you’re under your covers every day crying, not wanting to get out of bed,” says Dr. Fialk. “In fact, you tend to feel better quicker when you ask for help sooner rather than later.”
Geena, who has just started working with a life coach and has a support team in place for eating disorder recovery, agrees that getting outside help is powerful when it comes to making peace with one’s body. “I know [negative body image] is gonna come up again, but I’m gonna react differently to it next time because I know what the thing is that is driving it,” Geena says.
Above all, says Gist, don’t forget that it’s important to be forgive yourself for any not-so-nice thoughts about your body. “This can be such a traumatic time for someone with food or body issues, and the last thing we need is to beat the crap out of ourselves on top of those struggles,” she says. Adds Dr. Vasan: “Remember that your body is meant to change at different parts of life, and it’s okay if it changes during quarantine. After all, everything else has.”

"According to the MOTN survey, 63 per cent said they have suffered losses in their income due to the virus. Only 1 per cent of the people polled said their income has increased during the Covid-19 crisis. advertisement August 7, 2020 UPDATED: August 8, 2020 05:58 IST Income of 63% Indians has suffered due to Covid-19 pandemic, as per the MOTN survey (Getty Images)
The Covid-19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on the income of people in India. The impact has been felt across the board. Job or work loss has been the most prominent in North and South India, whereas income loss has affected the East and West. This was revealed in the findings of the bi-annual Mood of the Nation survey conducted by the India Today Group in coordination with Karvy Insights.
FULL RESULTS OF THE INDIA TODAY MOOD OF THE NATION AUGUST 2020
22 per cent of 12,021 respondents surveyed in the August 2020 round of India Today Mood of the Nation Survey said that they have lost their jobs or their businesses have failed due the coronavirus pandemic. 63 per cent said they have suffered losses in their income due to the virus.
Only 1 per cent of the people polled said their income has increased during the Covid-19 crisis. Meanwhile, 14 per cent respondents said there has been no change in their economic status due to Covid-19.
The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted economies around the world like no other event that experts can recollect since the Great Depression. Some of the strongest economies around the globe are struggling to cope with the situation in the wake of an unprecedented demand shock and a shutdown of all key economic activities that drive growth.
In the US, the world's most powerful economy, a massive number of jobs losses have been reported due to the Covid-19 pandemic. India, too, has been hit hard. India's GDP projection for FY21 has been slashed. The Covid-19 pandemic has been a huge blow to India, especially since many sectors were already facing a crisis when the virus storm hit.
The virus not only accelerated the crisis but also ended the good run that some sectors were enjoying. Adding to the worries in a steep demand shock that experts say classified as a long-term worry, citing uncertainty in the post-pandemic landscape.
If not all, key sectors that make up a larger portion of India's GDP were taken completely or partially out of action because of the nationwide lockdown. Reports of job losses, unpaid leaves and other concerns are being reported on a daily basis from such sectors.
METHODOLOGY OF MOTN POLL
The India Today Mood of the Nation (MOTN) poll was conducted by Delhi-based market research agency between July 15, 2020 and July 27, 2020. This poll has traditionally been conducted using face-to-face interviewing method. However, in this edition of the survey, due to the unprecedented situation arising out of Covid-19 pandemic, all interviews were conducted telephonically using a standard structured questionnaire, which was translated into regional languages.
A total of 12,021 interviews were conducted-67 per cent in rural and 33 per cent in urban areas -spread across 97 parliamentary constituencies and 194 assembly constituencies in 19 states-Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. In each of the assembly constituencies, a fixed number of interviews were done."
"Here are some of the bad habits that can speed up your ageing process. Try to avoid them as much as possible for healthy, glowing skin. Updated: August 7, 2020, 8:00 PM IST credits - Unplash (representation purpose only)
A healthy lifestyle can not only make you live longer but also make you look younger. Most of us wish to age gracefully, or at the very least not look and feel older than we actually are. You may believe it all depends on genetics, but it can actually be achieved with a lot of discipline and good habits too. Here are some of the bad habits that can speed up your ageing process - try to avoid them as much as possible for healthy, glowing skin.
1. Smoking
It is already a well-known fact that smoking affects all the body organs but a less common side-effect is that it also speeds up the normal ageing process of the skin, resulting in premature wrinkles. Smoking increases inflammation in the body which thereby damages the collagen and elastin protein of the skin, thus making the skin sag and wrinkle at an early age. Quitting smoking will benefit your overall health.
2. Stress
Stress is known to cause many illnesses in the body such as insomnia, depression, anxiety and even Alzheimer’s disease. But not many people know that stress can accelerate your ageing process. Stress causes inflammation in the body, which damages various parts of the body including the skin fibres. This makes the skin look dull and lifeless. Stress also damages the cellular structure of the body, which causes premature ageing of the cells. You can meditate, practice yoga or do any leisure activity to release your stress.
3. Exposure to sun
Continuous exposure of the skin to the ultraviolet rays of the sun can damage the elastic fibres of the skin. The elastic fibres of the skin help the skin remain firm. When they get damaged, the skin starts getting wrinkly and loose. Continuous exposure to sunlight also leads to age spots (otherwise called dark spots) on the face, hands and other sun-exposed areas. You must apply sunscreen on your hands and face before stepping out in the sun.
4. Sleep deprivation
Many of us notice dark circles under our eyes after an all-nighter. Continuous sleep deprivation can not only lead to dark circles but also other signs of ageing such as dark spots and fine lines, much earlier than expected. Researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles found that even a single night of insufficient sleep can make the cells of the body age quicker in the case of older adults. Sleep deprivation not only causes premature skin ageing but also decreases the ability of the skin to fight against the harmful rays of the sun. A person should sleep for at least 7 hours a day to keep the body healthy.
5. Lack of exercise
Exercising regularly improves blood circulation in the body, thus making the skin look radiant. Studies have shown that regular exercising helps people age slowly and live a healthier and more energetic life. The University of Birmingham, UK, conducted a study in the year 2018 in which they compared a group of older people who have exercised all their lives to two groups (similar aged and younger adults) who haven’t exercised regularly. The study concluded that people who exercise regularly showed fewer signs of ageing as compared to the other two groups. The doctors believed that exercising for half an hour a day is enough to keep your body fit and healthy.
6. Alcohol
Alcohol consumption not only increases the levels of triglycerides in your body but also allows fine lines and wrinkles to appear at an early age. Alcohol consumption makes these signs of ageing grow deeper with time. Alcohol causes dehydration in the body and also depletes it of vitamin A, which is essential for keeping the skin firm and youthful. Alcohol makes the skin dry, thus making it look dull and lifeless. Reducing the consumption of alcohol as you age is essential to avoid these effects.

Many questions are being raised on Disha Salian's death. Disha was a former manager of the late Sushant Singh Rajput, who allegedly died by suicide after falling from the 14th floor of a high-rise building.
According to a news report, Disha was partying with her friends and fiance on the night of her death. She locked herself in her room after a sudden bout of depression. When her friends broke open the door, they found that she had jumped off the balcony.
India Today, which claims to have accessed Disha's friends' Whatsapp texts, revealed what happened in the few hours leading up to her death. According to the messages, Disha, her friends and her fiancé were partying at night. After consuming a large amount of alcohol, Disha had a bout of deep sadness and said, 'no one cares about anyone anymore.'
When one of her friends told her to not be a 'party pooper', Disha allegedly went and locked herself in a room. After a while, when her friends could not get a response from Disha, her fiancé and others broke open the door to find that she had fallen from the balcony.
The report further claimed that Disha was alive when her friends rushed downstairs to her, but was declared dead upon being taken to a hospital.
These details of Disha's death was shared on her college friends' Whatsapp group, reported India Today. They were found to be true upon police verification.
This stands in the face of various conspiracy theories connecting her death to that of Sushant Singh Rajput's, who died almost a week after Disha, on June 14. BJP MP and Maharashtra's former Chief Minister Narayan Rane had alleged that Disha had been raped and murdered, and that Sushant knew of this and was threatened by the same group which had killed Disha."
"As the investigation of Sushant Singh Rajput ’s death case continues with new twists and turns, the late actor’s ex-girlfriend, Ankita Lokhande took to Twitter to share a picture of herself with the late actor's mother's photo-frame in her hand. She captioned the post, ""Believe you are together!""
Check out the tweet here:
Believe you are together! https://t.co/p9dPnjDp4U
&mdash; Ankita lokhande (@anky1912) 1596814740000
In her recent interviews, the 'Manikarnika' actress has shared that Sushant was not a person who would commit suicide. She also stated that when they were together, they have faced worse situations than these.
She also stated that his girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty is currently only one who can answer the questions about Sushant’s alleged depression."
"Box Office No-Go Why the conflict over the movie industry’s embrace of video on demand reflects a century-long symbiotic relationship gone sour. AMC is just Trollin’. Written by Ernie Smith on May 01, 2020 film , movie history , movie theaters , movies , paramount pictures , pay per view , theater , video on demand
Today in Tedium: Of the many, many overreactions that have occurred as a result of the disease that has been the only topic anyone wants to talk about these days, perhaps the most interesting that doesn’t involve a face mask may go to AMC Theaters, which took a modest comment about a success story brought on by unusual times and turned it into an all-out business war. Trolls World Tour , which was released to premium video on demand (PVOD) due to the fact that nearly all theaters literally weren’t open, proved to be an unavoidable success story for NBCUniversal. “The results for Trolls World Tour have exceeded our expectations and demonstrated the viability of PVOD,” NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell said . “As soon as theaters reopen, we expect to release movies on both formats.” AMC called foul and said it would ban Universal films from its theaters —the negotiating equivalent of bringing a gun to a poker game. But conflicts between film studios and theater chains are nothing new, and today’s Tedium analyzes how that relationship has helped to shape the modern film industry. — Ernie @ Tedium

( igorovsyannykov/Pixabay ) The shifting fates of film studios and movie theaters leans on one essential Supreme Court case
Paramount Pictures is one of the oldest continuously active companies in the film industry, with roots dating all the way to 1912, when early film producer and nickelodeon owner Adolph Zukor bailed out the production of a film about Queen Elizabeth I of England after its former studio went bankrupt. Zukor’s funding allowed the film, most commonly known as Les Amours de la reine Élisabeth , to see release in the U.S., where it proved one of the first successful feature-length films in the American market.
The film company, originally known as Famous Players Film Company, came prominence thanks to a novel idea at the time: Zukor vertically integrated the production, distribution, and exhibition of films.
In other words, Zukor, through his various companies, owned both the film studio and the theaters in which his company’s films appeared. (He also, side note, owned many of the stars, a general concept reflected in the Paramount Pictures logo even now.) This combination of production and distribution is common today—I mean, it’s literally what Netflix is —but at a time when there were relatively few options for film distribution, this system created antitrust problems over time.
Now, it perhaps seems quaint that the idea of a major studio controlling a large portion of its distribution mechanism was once controversial, but it’s in large part because there are literally thousands of film production companies out there today, along with an infinite number of distribution methods. But way back when, options were extremely limited.
The stars around the Paramount logo reflect the stars it had under contract early in its history.
In the 1930s, after effectively following Paramount’s lead, four other major studios—MGM, Twentieth Century Fox, Warner Bros., and RKO—also had tightly integrated ties between their production facilities in Hollywood and their theaters. Two others, Universal and Columbia, tried to do the same, but never reached the scale to make it effective.
Reaching that scale wasn’t exactly easy, and during periods of struggle, having a full system behind your studio could be a huge liability. Paramount, for one, went bankrupt and nearly collapsed entirely in the mid-1930s, the result of massive overspending on its film productions in the early “talkie” era and the weight of running a whole chain of theaters during a depression.
But when things were working, the studios ran the show. This created some natural abuses of power, with the most common being something called block booking, or requiring theaters to book a bunch of secondary junk, sight unseen, along with a good film. This was an Adolph Zukor idea through and through, dating to at least the 1910s.
“Zukor could force theaters to rent an entire slate of mediocre films, just to get their hands on one Mary Pickford feature,” said Scott Berg, a biographer of contemporary Samuel Goldwyn, in an interview with Investor’s Business Daily .
This concept, beyond harming the quality of the cinema and being anti-competitive, kept independent producers out , and that may have eventually proved the studio system’s downfall.

Regulators repeatedly tried to rein in the studio system throughout the 1920s and 1930s, in part because of the sheer amount of power it represented, finally succeeding through a 1948 Supreme Court ruling, United States vs. Paramount Pictures . The decision, which generally affirmed a consent decree decided upon in a 1940 federal court case, represents a turning point in film history—as it killed the studio system as it was known then and prevented film studios from double-dealing by also owning theater chains. While the case had Paramount at its center, every other major studio was a defendant.
“To the extent that these acquisitions were the fruits of monopolistic practices or restraints of trade, they should be divested, and no permission to buy out the other owner should be given a defendant,” the decision stated .
In the long run, this decision was good for the film industry, because it allowed for the growth of independence in the industry, letting new studios and art-house theaters gain prominence outside the influence of the major Hollywood film houses.
The problem for the theaters, however, is that right around the time of the Paramount decision, television was just about to go mainstream—and television networks had no such issues with vertical integration. 17.35%
The percentage of movie theaters owned by major studios at the time of the 1948 Paramount decision. Despite not being an outright monopoly, critics have noted that it actually represented a de facto one. A 1992 analysis in the Hofstra Law Review found 90 percent of important and prominent theaters were owned by major studios. It wasn’t about how many theaters they owned; it was really an issue of which ones.
( Daan Stevens/Unsplash ) How television proved to be the original sin for movie theater chains
If one were to create a ground zero for all the problems that movie theaters had in the latter half of the 20th century, nearly all of them would be rooted in the existence of television.
Television gave people a reason to stay home rather than go out for entertainment. And even back then, it was well-understood why, at least among theater owners.
In a 1949 speech to members of the Theater Owners of North Carolina and South Carolina, Theater Owners of America President Arthur H. Lockwood pointed at the dreary sky when he explained the understanding of television’s appeal.
“And on a day like today, the average movie-goer would much prefer to stay at home by his television set and avoid traffic, parking problems, and the expense of a theater ticket,” he said, according to The Charlotte Observer .
And while it wasn’t an immediate shift in demand, the gradual move from big screen to small is effectively what led to the outburst over Trolls World Tour this week.
The value of the TV wasn’t immediately obvious to many film studios, as proven by the fact that, after the Supreme Court case shook up theater ownership, many studios, Paramount included , ending up selling the rights to their vintage content, thinking it was less valuable now that they didn’t own a theater chain that could frequently replay it. Oh, how wrong they were.
(One important exception to this rule highlights how much of a folly this was: Walt Disney, who skipped out on a deal with United Artists in the 1930s because they wanted to control the television rights to his work before he even knew what television was, felt that RKO was undervaluing his prior work and started his own distribution arm in 1953 . Given the popularity of Disney+, his decision was proven correct.)
Quickly, the added competition from television would prove hard for theaters to ignore. Efforts to differentiate theaters from television date back to the 1950s, when letterboxing became a common way to separate new-release films from golden-era productions.
But one particular thing scared the movie theater industry more than anything else ? The idea that new-release films would somehow appear on television rather than in the theaters. A 1960 article from the Hollywood-area Valley Times laid out the deep fears among theater owners, as represented by the then-primary trade group, the Theater Owners Of America:
If pay-TV should become successful the exhibitors envision “shuttered theaters” throughout the country, in small towns and large.
They are plagued by recurring dreams of their former customers silting around pay-TV in droves, whole families watching new films at home for the price one adult would pay at the theater box office.
The theater men are outspoken in their criticism of the present Telemeter wired operation in Toronto, and the pending over-the-air experiment in Hartford, Conn. Their salvation, they feel, is seeking legislation which would outlaw any form of subscription television, and with this in mind the group recently inaugurated a campaign in its member theaters to obtain 30 million signatures on anti-pay-TV petitions.
(Sebastien LE DEROUT/Pixabay)
Experiments like pay TV were tried for decades before they became common, and theaters saw them as a threat just about every time. As an example, Computer Cinema, an early attempt to put pay-per-view in hotel rooms that was successful enough that it actually encouraged people to rent hotel rooms just to watch pay per view. According to author Kerry Segrave , the National Association of Theatre Owners called the initiative “a direct attack on our breadbasket.”
Of course, the rise of pay-per-view couldn’t be stopped—not when premium channels were being brought in through cable boxes and even UHF .
And then there was home video, which was upsetting theater owners as early as 1981, when 20th Century Fox floated the idea of releasing tapes three months after a film’s theatrical release, something the National Association of Theatre Owners didn’t like.
The theatrical window, the separation between when a film appears in a theater and when it hits a secondary format such as video, has been a complicating factor between the film industry and movie theater chains for decades. Observers would frequently watch to see when efforts to sell or distribute films on new formats would cause potential tension with the theater industry.
At one time, that window was six months on average for most releases, but up to a year for major films; but in recent years, the window has started to make less and less sense as much more of our content has been viewed on windows far from a movie theater.
Oscar nominees, which often are never big box-office hits anyway, now often only have a tiny theatrical window and a quick leap to video on demand, which probably drives the theater industry nuts. But until now, they could count on blockbusters like Trolls World Tour . Not anymore.
A 2016 Los Angeles Times piece perfectly captured the tension created by an industry being propped up by little more than a business agreement.
“In today’s culture of instant, virtually unlimited access to entertainment, waiting three months after opening weekend to stream a summer blockbuster can seem like an eternity,” the story stated. “Movie studios’ attempts to toy with the delay have sometimes been met with swift backlash from theaters.”
It’s unusual to think about, but United States vs. Paramount Pictures , the 1948 Supreme Court ruling, untethered the fates of theater chains and the film industry. It was a good decision at the time, as it gave theaters freedom and discouraged dangerous consolidation among film studios. But is there a case that the two industries need to be more directly linked once again? 20k
The number of customers that took part in an industry research test called “Your Choice TV,” an attempt to see if consumers would go for a non-linear approach to accessing channels on the cable dial. It did not use the internet—unlike Hong Kong’s ITV, it was less an all-you-can-eat streaming service and more a pay-per-view service that sold the ability to shift time. The platform, according to a white paper by creator (and then-Discovery Communications CEO) John Hendricks, essentially gave an entire cable channel to a single show every week, and did this over 54 channels. In a New York Times article in 1993, Hendricks implied that he wanted to run first-run movies using this method , too, though it never came to pass.
In 2020, there’s nothing stopping a film studio from also running a broadcast television network, a streaming service, an internet provider, or even the largest cable service in the United States.
(I am literally describing Comcast, the owner of NBCUniversal, the creator and distributor of Trolls World Tour .)
But one thing that it cannot own, even to this day, is a chain of movie theaters. In many ways, this is good—it discourages a single chain from barring distribution to certain kinds of films, for example.
But it is not the trump card that it was in the 1940s. And the reason for that is that distribution methods are so wide everywhere else. You can have a successful movie that makes tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars without it ever having the chance to set foot in a traditional movie theater. Trolls World Tour proved it.
In a world where VOD platforms and VOD apps rule the roost, can theaters compete with video-on-demand? A lot of nervous executives are leaning towards “no.”
The movie theater is an important part of life. Even if many people prefer to stay home, it is worth saving. But it is expensive and faces competition from screens large and small. It deserves protection—and the theatrical window ain’t doing it anymore.
Perhaps it’s why, for this reason, that the Justice Department announced last fall that it’s looking to terminate the consent decrees that prevented major movie studios from owning movie theater chains for decades.
“We have determined that the decrees, as they are, no longer serve the public interest, because the horizontal conspiracy—the original violation animating the decrees—has been stopped,” Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim told the American Bar Association last fall .
If that happens, it may actually prove to be an unexpected godsend for the movie theater industry. The reason is that those theaters were already struggling before the COVID-19 crisis, and it’s already been speculated that the film studios may be in a position to bail out what could soon be bankrupt chains.
Which makes the AMC’s tough words seem more like a bargaining chip than they actually are. NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell can talk about putting movies on premium video on demand, even in passing, because he knows he has the upper hand.
There is of course a case that film studios should probably not be able to own TV stations or streaming networks, or that a streaming network like Netflix should not be able to build itself into a studio so large that it warrants MPAA membership. But because they can do all these things, it makes the prevention of studios from owning theaters seem arbitrary.
In the roughly 70 years since the Supreme Court weighed in on vertical integration between film studios and movie theaters, the film studios have been able to vertically integrate just about everywhere else that matters.
And while theater chains are by no means small, a failure to make a change now could diminish their future in a big way.
Chew on those Raisinets.

With me in the driver seat, both my uncle and brother can stretch themselves out right behind me (both are fairly tall at 6'3"" and 5'11"" and I'm 5'11"" too). Infact, I prefer being a second row passenger than being a driver in the Hexa. So, if someone asks me to change roles, I do it without a fuss because I get to chill in the second row of the Hexa. The captain seats are comfy and hold you right in place no matter how bad the roads are. You've also got a 5A USB fast charger port (deleted in the subsequent updates) to charge your phone on the go, so that's a plus for me. The sun blinds do a very good job of keeping the heat at bay.
What makes the ride more comfortable apart from the seats is the ride quality of the car altogether. However bad the roads are, the car doesn't lose its composure and I love it for that. After having experienced the Harrier after owning the Hexa for a fairly long time, I'd say the Hexa rides a lot better on both on-road and off-road (please do note the discussion is not about the handling and driving dynamics of the car).
The Automatic gearbox eases up things for us in a metro like Hyderabad. I am glad we didn't pick up the MT over the AT. The shift quality of the 6-speed Torque Converter is really good and one can barely identify the shifts happening and the gearbox is quick to respond to your throttle inputs. The fuel efficiency is respectable for a car of this size. The car returns a very respectable 9-kmpl in the city traffic over short runs (my dad's office is only 5-kms away) and when I take it to my college and work runs, the car returns 10-11 kmpl all day long in moderate to heavy traffic over long distances. A full tank of diesel lasts a cool 500-kms before we top it up in reserve. Tankful to tankful figures have averaged at ~ 9-kmpl most of the times. The 10-speaker JBL Audio system needs a special mention from my end. I love the way the setup sounds. Be it a 90s track by Udit Narayan or Kumar Shanu or the track what a typical millennial listens to in 2020, one is sure to appreciate the audio quality of the Hexa. Infact, of all the cars we've ever owned, Hexa gets the best audio system right off the factory.
Now with the honeymoon period over, let's get to the harsh (or not-so-harsh; left to the readers and is highly subjective) realities of owning a Hexa.
To start off with, the car simply doesn't feel as tight as it felt on Day-1. I mean, I do understand the car ages with time but I feel the Hexa is ageing a lot earlier than anticipated.
My car has clocked close to 31,000-kms at the time of this update, but my car feels like a 50,000-kms driven car. The car is never subjected to abuse or redlining (forget redlining, the car barely breaches the 2500-rpm mark for 90% of the times) nor is it thrashed on the bad roads. My dad daily drives this car and the car is often subjected to the best of the roads in the Army Cantonment. The only time our car see bad roads are when it enters our colony where we stay. The road condition is nothing home to talk about and we usually creep inside the colony (<20-kmph). The plastics on the inside squeak (and occasional rattles on bad section of roads) like if someone is bouncing on a spring. I'm someone who appreciates a silent drive but the squeaks can sometime be too much to handle but the music system thankfully mutes most of these squeaks and my dad doesn't pay much attention to these either. Whenever a rattle or a squeak which gets on my nerve, I drive the car down to the ASC to get it fixed. The guys fix it but in the next few days, a new rattle or squeak crops up from another section of the car. It's something you'll have to make peace with it.
Second, the NVH levels have gone up quite a bit from before. At idle, the steering wheel vibrates a bit (which wasn't the case as before) and the overall noise and vibration levels from the engine have gone up too. In between, the NVH levels from the engine were a bit too much to handle for me, so I got the car checked by the technicians at the ASC and the TVD was replaced under warranty and things are a lot better for now. Along with the replacement of the Torsional Vibration Damper (TVD), they also have tightened an engine mount which was found to be a bit loose. After all this, the NVH levels have gone down by a good margin but it still isn't as good as before. I've made peace with it for now. Even the engine feels harsh and crude for some reason. Been in another Hexa recently and the engine harshness and overall NVH levels were much better (had clocked close to 40,000-kms). I'm not sure as to what is wrong with my car.
Have had a few warranty claims (to the tune of rusted exhaust pipe, failing AC clutch and relay and a few other minor electricals inside the cabin) and the claim appraisal and approval was smooth. Since November 2019, I've been to the ASC almost every month for some warranty claim or another. The Authorised Service Center (Malik Cars, Bowenpally in my case) is doing a very good job at attending to customer grievances and they're putting in a lot of effort to troubleshoot the problem as well. If not for the service provided by the ASC, I would've been a dejected customer by now.
Then the looming threat of the exhaust manifold leaking oil (a common niggle as reported by a sizeable number of owners) is always at the back of my mind. I almost freaked out once after having seen the oil breathe through the head (which is normal). I cleaned it up and it's been five months since I last cleaned it up. The oil is breathing out as usual and there isn't any leak from the exhaust manifold gasket or the engine head. Fingers crossed. I've still got two more years of extended warranty left and I hope that any mechanical part which is prone to premature failure better fail in this duration. The tyres have got about ~ 50% of tread left which is a good thing. I've still got another couple of years before I get to swap the tyres. The battery after serving us for close to 3-years, 4-months conked off a couple of days ago. Replacement battery is already in. I'm surprised the battery lasted this long because the warranty period for the same was only for an year. I was anticipating this to happen since the last couple of months and this finally happened a couple of days ago.
Now one can always debate the fact that a car is never free of niggles. I truly agree to that statement and in my defence, I'd like to ask you all one simple question. Do you really want to head to the ASC every now and then to get an issue rectified? After all, I've spent 22L on a brand new car 3-years ago for the peace of mind in the initial years of ownership atleast. Running repairs and a few (un)expected niggles are a part of any car ownership. But that doesn't mean I am ready to go to the ASC almost every other month to get an issue sorted. One issue is solved and another crops up.
Sure, I can turn a blind eye and keep driving the car as-is. But have we really spent 22 big ones of our hard-earned money to live with that sort of a compromise? I for one, can't live with such a compromise after paying so much but am forced to live with it because it's a depreciation disaster and all I can do is run this car down till I get to upgrade and keep fixing the minor issues which crop over the course of time. I can just hope the car doesn't give up on me.
Despite all these issues, dad and I love the car for what it is. This is a typical love-hate relationship where in you make in serious compromises just because you don't want to part ways with the other one who's a part of the relationship. You loved the car for what it was, so you also have to accept its flaws. Agreed, these flaws have come up over a due course of time. As they say, change is inevitable, but then you simply can't abandon someone because they've changed and they simply aren't the ones they were before right? (Do I sound like a guy coaxing himself?)
I can just hope Sinbad proves to be reliable in the longer run and I pray to go my prayers come true. On another note, I've finally procured the piano Black trim for the boot door. This will be replaced with the chrome trim which the XT line of variants get. Even the boot sill will be replaced with the rubberized black insert. The car was recently ""detailed"" at home. It was a learning curve for both, me and my dad and was quite an experience. Pictures will follow in the subsequent posts as I'm a bit too lazy to resize and upload them to this post. Till then, please bear with me"
"Sushant Singh Rajput’s case is getting intense by the day with every hour new or rather shocking revelation coming to light. At the moment, its his girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty who is making headlines all across after his father KK Singh, registered a case against her. In his FIR, he has accused her of abatement to suicide, blackmailing, harassment and theft among many other charges. He has also revealed that she instigated his son to take his own life by torturing him.
Soon after SSR left for heavenly abode, the Mumbai Police while investigating his case had interrogated Rhea for nine straight hours. During the same, she was asked about their relationship/marriage/breakup, films and his depression among other factors.
Now, according to Pinkvilla, in her statement to Mumbai police, Rhea had allegedly claimed that she ‘vacated’ Sushant’s house on June 8, following a fight and their breakup but was in touch with the actor.
However, in fresh reports, Republic TV has contradicted her claims saying that Rhea, in her petition to the Supreme Court, wrote how she had planned to return to the late actor’s house. Republic also alleges how Sushant’s outgoing call records hint at him calling Rhea multiple times after she left; however, those records weren’t visible in Rhea’s CDR.
As per Republic, ""the actress had allegedly blocked the late actor and had cut off every communication with him post-June 8, 2020.
The CDR records accessed by Republic TV bring into disrepute Rhea's claim in her Supreme Court petition wherein she had insinuated that she planned to return to Sushant's house,” reports the portal.
In other news, India Today, which managed to get access to Sushant’s call records, reported that Rhea had called him multiple times during January, when was in Chandigarh, hence pressurising him to come back. It also alleged that Sushant had informed his family about Rhea’s scheme of putting him in a mental hospital."

As we all know , the pandemic COVID-19 has uprooted life. From social gatherings to daily errands, everything has been entirely changed, and most of us don’t like this transition (to say the least).
The world is eagerly awaiting the arrival of the COVID-19 vaccine for the safety of ourselves and for those we love, and the return of life as we know it.
However , the reality and sadness are that life will not be going back to its original state for a long time due to issues and questions around the actual vaccine and when and how the vaccine will be distributed.
An important point to remember is that this will not be one of those light switch things when we suddenly have a vaccine and everyone is vaccinated. This will take some time, dean of the University of Washington’s School of Public Health, Hilary Godwin said.
We are very lucky that we are developing many vaccine candidates, but we have indeed accelerated this process greatly, so any super-effective opportunity is not big.
In the next few years, life will be different, but what exactly does this mean?
Below, Experts in the fields of public health and mental health have discussed the expected world situation after the advent of the COVID-19 vaccine. 1. It is expected that several countries (especially the United States) will transform into a culture of wearing masks
One year from now, and even further, Godwin expects to still see people wearing masks in public places, especially those who are more susceptible to COVID-19.
I think a significant part of the future will be greater expectations for masks. Except in clinical settings, in the United States , wearing masks for infectious disease control is not part of the culture. She appended mask-wearing will become more normal, which is the same as in many Asian countries in recent years. We will see the change in this direction.
Thus , Several countries, especially the United States may be adopted a mask-wearing culture, even after a COVID-19 vaccine arrives. 2. Even after the vaccine is released, scientists and doctors must understand the effectiveness and efficacy of the vaccine
The speed at which scientists are working to develop the COVID-19 vaccine is rapid, but the excitement surrounding the development of a fast track vaccine has raised concerns among many health professionals.
Aparna Kumar , a nurse scientist and assistant professor at Thomas Jefferson University, said that the speed of the vaccine development is like nothing we’ve ever seen before. Science is advancing very fast, which is great, but it also limits what we understand about the effectiveness of vaccines.
She defines the effectiveness of the vaccine in terms of vaccine performance under ideal conditions, such as in a randomized controlled trial. Effectiveness indicates the extent to which the vaccine lessens the frequency of disease in the unvaccinated population.
Kumar who is also the Chief Community Officer at Dear Pandemic, an all-female team of clinicians and researchers who are responding to COVID-19 misinformation by sharing convenient and reliable information on social media- she said the vaccine may exterminate the virus either.
She pointed out that the vaccine for children is extremely effective , but like the flu vaccines, its effective rate is 40% to 62%, depending on the year and the influenza virus strain.
She further stated that the influenza vaccine can prevent many people from getting seriously ill and from the spread of the disease in the community, but we still know that many people will get sick.
She added that the findings regarding the effectiveness of the vaccine are difficult to discuss unless the vaccine is deployed to the community, which means that health professionals cannot predict the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine until it is prescribed to the public. 3. Doctors also anticipate concerns about the actual distribution of the Vaccine
The rapid development of the COVID-19 vaccine has also raised concerns about the actual distribution of the approved vaccine.
Tony Moody, a physician-scientist at Duke University , stated that mainly due to supply chain issues, the deployment of vaccines will face many challenges.
How do you make enough doses and distribute them on time? We can do great things by using the vaccine production capacity. It’s done very well-we produce billions of flu vaccines every year-but it will be very challenging to make this new product capable of rapid distribution.
He assumes issues around the glass vials and stoppers needed for vaccine distribution and storage. He further stated that most of the vials and stoppers are manufactured abroad. If can’t import the ships, you won’t be able to get the resources you need. Even if you manufacture a vaccine, can you get enough vials? 4. Rely on fewer business trips and more remote work opportunities
With the development of digital technology and the realization that certain industries can easily continue to develop without sending workers across the world or the country, Godwin said she hopes that people in most industries will have less business travel.
I guess business trips may be reduced. We can now accomplish many things without being in the same room, she said.
5. Will employers be more flexible with work from home policies even after the COVID-19 vaccine’s available?
She said that the work-from-home routine has accelerated the adoption of new technologies such as Zoom in a way that would never happen. She hopes the company will be more flexible in its remote work policy-especially if it can still get work done at home while preventing people from getting sick and helping the company save operating costs. 6. Don’t plan to attend any sporting event or a concert for the time being
Unfortunately , as the vaccine for coronavirus is rolling out and the determination of its effectiveness is being made, crowded concerts or sporting events will not become part of our new normal.
Moody said that it will be very difficult to convince somebody to return to large gatherings solely for recreational or entertainment purposes. I think you will see a group of people gather at smaller gatherings. I suspect we will have big events with thousands of people gathered together.
He especially expressed concern about the crowds inside the performing arts and sports venues. He asked how to safely welcome a group of people in an enclosed area and what this means for the venue.
7. How will we get people back to the venue as soon as possible? Will the venue charge triple because the venue can only fill half of the seats?
Moody replied : This makes people unable to bear so many things. I think this will be a real challenge.
As the circulation of fresh air helps reduce the risk of the virus, he added that outdoor social gatherings will become more common. In the next few years, outdoor gatherings may continue to become more common. 8. Expected to have a significant impact on Psychology, Society, and Social-culture
There is no doubt that people are extremely affected by the major events that take place in their lives. People who have experienced the great depression have different tendencies than those who have not. People who grew up during the Vietnam war had different opinions from those born after the war. It is foreseeable that modern-day society will be shaped by the coronavirus pandemic.
The psychological sequelae of disasters usually appear six months after the event ends, noted by Edwin Fisher, Professor of health behavior, at the Gilling School of Global Public Health at North Carolina University at Chapel Hill . He predicts that this pandemic will have long term an impact on mental health and change culture, leaving millions of people especially Americans in social and physical isolation for several months.
Fisher said : It is everywhere because it’s all omnipresent as it attacks us 24/7, we often cannot track the impact of COVID on our daily lives, emotions, and consciousness. Well, what is the similar effect we have had for more than 100 years with the world’s largest pandemic? There will be many, many long-term effects.
He is worried about suicide rate, depression, and marital problems-which are currently increasing due to the pandemic. 9. Looking forward to a public health system that is more prepared to respond to the pandemics
Kumar said that after experiencing a pandemic, our health system will only be better prepared for any future health crises or future coronavirus outbreaks.
During this pandemic , we have learned a lot about our public health system and structures, and these situations will get better, Kumar said. As we move on, we are extra prepared for a potential future outbreak. With these systems and structures, we can reactivate them when needed.
Now, most of the public is also aware of pandemic combat behaviors such as social distancing and wearing masks, two things that were almost unheard of in most countries, especially in the United States before this year.
The public health system will be extra prepared for future health emergencies . 10. Expect several levels of discord in the entire community
Although the vast majority of people are in the countdown, Fisher warned that any unrealistic and premature hype about vaccines may lead people to believe that once the needle hits their body, all the problems will end.
He said that with the advent of vaccines, conflicts, social disharmony, and unintended consequences are likely to occur.
The community, colleagues, friends, and family will face hard decisions about how to maintain healthy security and safely socialize after months and months of isolation to send their children to school where there may be unvaccinated students.
He also emphasized that the disease has highlighted and exacerbated potential problems regarding vaccine distribution and racial inequality. 11. The Virus will not Disappear Completely
Unfortunately, COVID-19 will not go away completely even when the vaccine is deployed. Godwin remarked that several countries including the United States have a long history of people being opposed to the use of vaccines .
Godwin further stated that we have seen people who say they don’t want to get a vaccine, which limits our ability to generate herd immunity, which protects those people who can’t get the vaccine or don’t have it.
She warned that , as a result of those who choose not to vaccinate , the virus will continue to spread even if effective vaccines are widely available.
She emphasized that we will have to live with the COVID-19 virus for a while. Share this:"
"A lifetime before he served two presidents as national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft was just 12 when he decided to become a West Point cadet after reading about cadet life. After he graduated with the Class of 1947, he decided to join the Army Air Corps and train to be a fighter pilot. He achieved that goal, too, but then fate shot down his plans. Last Updated: August 7, 2020, 10:52 PM IST Share this:
WASHINGTON A lifetime before he served two presidents as national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft was just 12 when he decided to become a West Point cadet after reading about cadet life. After he graduated with the Class of 1947, he decided to join the Army Air Corps and train to be a fighter pilot. He achieved that goal, too, but then fate shot down his plans.
Just months after earning his wings, Scowcroft was flying over New Hampshire when his F-51 crashed in a frozen swamp. A broken back and other injuries kept him in the hospital for two years. He flew again, but so much time had passed that he decided to turn from tactics and operations to strategy and planning.
And he did. Playing a prominent role in American foreign policy, Scowcroft served as national security adviser to Presidents Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush, the only national security adviser to two different administrations. He also advised Presidents Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan on defense issues.
I dont have a quick, innovative mind. I dont automatically think of good, new ideas. What I do better is pick out good ideas from bad ideas, he told The Washington Post on the eve of the George H.W. Bush administration. He added: It is comforting to be doing things that make a difference. In the end, its the job thats more important.
Scowcroft, who died Thursday of natural causes at age 95 at his home in Falls Church, Virginia, was appointed Fords national security adviser in 1975 as he retired from the Air Force with the rank of lieutenant general. He served as national security adviser to Bush, by then a close friend, during the four years of the Bush administration, 1989-93.
Scowcroft’s death was confirmed Friday by Jim McGrath, a longtime spokesperson for Bush, who died in 2018.
An independent streak and a penchant for honesty burnished Scowcroft’s reputation in government. He differed at times with the Reagan administration on missile policy. In 2002, as President George W. Bush prepared to invade Iraq, Scowcroft argued against attacking Saddam Husseins regime.
Scowcroft was described at times as both gentle and tough, a brilliant coordinator most concerned with results, a tireless worker accustomed to 18-hour days. In a 2011 study of his career, historian David F. Schmitz noted that Scowcroft had been at the center of numerous post-Vietnam War discussions of American foreign policy.
He was part of the presidential administrations that grappled with U.S. responses to the collapse of communism in Europe, the crackdown in China after the Tiananmen Square protests and Saddam Husseins invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent Gulf War.
The key tenets of his thinking, shaped by the Second World War, were that national security policy had to protect the nation from aggression, provide international stability, control arms while maintaining preparedness, and shape an international environment that was conducive to Americas goals and needs, Schmitz wrote.
Scowcroft was born March 19, 1925, in Ogden, Utah. His father owned a wholesale grocery business, which helped the Mormon family avoid the tough times that came with the Great Depression.
After refocusing his military career in the wake of the plane crash, Scowcroft earned a masters degree at Columbia University in 1953 and then taught Russian history at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. In 1957, he began studying at the Strategic Intelligence School in Washington. Two years later, he was an assistant air attach in the American Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, then taught political science at the U.S. Air Force Academy.
Scowcroft was assigned to Air Force headquarters and the Defense Department during the 1960s and earned a doctorate in international relations from Columbia in 1967. He was appointed military assistant to Nixon in 1972. A year later he became deputy assistant for national security under Henry Kissinger, Nixons national security adviser.
He left the White House with the election of Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1976. He set up a consulting firm serving international businesses and eventually joined Kissinger at Kissinger Associates, a consulting firm with similar goals.
Scowcroft served on Carters advisory committee on arms control and was chairman of Reagans Commission on Strategic Forces, which focused on the effort to modernize U.S. nuclear weapons. He also served on the three-member Tower Commission, which investigated the arms-for-hostages affair that occurred during the Reagan administration.
Scowcroft had been a close friend of George H.W. Bush since they had served together in the Nixon administration. With Bushs election in 1988, Scowcroft was interested in leading the Pentagon as defense secretary during the Bush administration. He accepted a return engagement as national security adviser when he realized he would be at the presidents side instead of running the massive bureaucracy at the Defense Department.
After Bush lost his reelection bid to Democrat Bill Clinton in 1992, Scowcroft returned to consulting. He co-wrote with Bush a book about the Cold War, A World Transformed, published in 1998, and with Carter national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski the book America and the World: Conversations on the Future of American Foreign Policy in 2008.
Scowcroft angered the White House of his friends son, President George W. Bush, when in 2002 he publicly expressed the view that little evidence tied Saddam Hussein to terrorist organizations and warned that war with Iraq could damage if not destroy U.S. alliances in the region.
In a column for The Wall Street Journal, Scowcroft wrote: The central point is that any campaign against Iraq, whatever the strategy, cost and risks, is certain to divert us for some indefinite period from our war on terrorism. Worse, there is a virtual consensus in the world against an attack on Iraq at this time. So long as that sentiment persists, it would require the U.S. to pursue a virtual go-it-alone strategy against Iraq, making any military operations correspondingly more difficult and expensive.
Given his relationship with the Bush family, Scowcrofts criticism of the administration carried particular weight. I thought they were rushing to judgment and making a serious mistake, Scowcroft recalled during an interview with the West Point Center for Oral History. His concerns, made privately before he spoke out publicly, were pretty much rejected by the younger Bushs White House, he said.
President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, said in a statement Friday that they were saddened to learn of Scowcrofts death.
This patriot had a long career of distinguished service to our country. As a retired Air Force general, he gave sound and thoughtful advice to several presidents. He was an especially important advisor to my father and an important friend, Bush said. Also Watch

"Failure to address underlying ecological issues leading to floods, says CUSAT expert
The gradual transition in the strength of the wind from 14 km/hour on August 1 to 85 km/hr on August 6 has triggered heavy rainfall over the west coast of the country and it is likely to last for two to three days, according to observations by scientists at the Advanced Centre for Atmospheric Radar Research (ACARR) in the Cochin University of Science and Technology.
“In conjunction with the recent development of depressions over the Bay of Bengal, radar observations taken at the ACARR show that the strength of the wind at lower troposphere (below 2 km in the atmosphere) observed from radar on August 1 was around 14 km/hour, which gradually picked up momentum and it reached about 85 km/hour on August 6,” Ajil Kottayil, scientist at ACARR, said on Friday. Wind a trigger
This kind of transition in the wind triggers heavy rainfall over the west coast of India. A heavy rainfall thus triggered could last two to three days, he said.
Stating that extreme heavy rainfall events during monsoon season were not an abrupt phenomena, Dr. Ajil said certain priming occur prior to their manifestation. “They evolve following an intensification of low-pressure system over central India. The transition in monsoon circulation from normal to heavy rainfall is in fact gradual, which actually facilitates their predictability. The wind observations taken at the ACARR can ideally capture the signals of heavy rainfall a few days prior to their actual incidence,” he said. Kerala situation
On why Kerala was facing the continued threat of successive floods, Dr. Ajil said “it would be because we have failed to address the underlying ecological issues promoting water stagnation. Extreme weather events cannot be prevented any time in future but equipping ourselves to a changed world is the only sustainable solution”, he said.
The scientist said the past two years, though bitter, was but a novel experience for the State already ensnared in unscientific planning, illegal encroachments, and paralleled with a dense population.

"People urged to prepare themselves for challenging times following rain havoc and COVID-19
Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Friday said twin disasters confronted the State.
The threat of rain havoc has raised the spectre of mass displacement of people from disaster-prone localities.
Their accommodation in crowded relief camps and collective rescue work by large groups of people could potentially exacerbate the public health crisis caused by the unabated spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Resources stretched
The government's resources were stretched to the limit. Mr. Vijayan urged the public to contribute their mite to the effort to combat the twin calamities that threatened to overwhelm the State.
The mudslide in Rajamala had caught the government by surprise. It had occurred in a zone not considered geologically vulnerable to landslips. Directive to Collectors
The administration was not taking any chances. It has ordered District Collectors to immediately move plantation workers living in unstable localities to safer zones till the inclement weather blew over.
Mr. Vijayan said the weather forecast for the State was grim. Rain was expected to intensify in north Kerala. Many rivers were already in spate. Shutters of several important dams have been opened to keep storage levels within the safety threshold.
Flooding threatened low-lying population centres such as Kochi. The State faced crop loss, destruction of property, loss of production, lack of employment and further economic depression.
The government has put the police on full alert. It has sought more units of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) for rescue work. The administration has requested the Indian Air Force, Army and Navy to remain on standby to reinforce State law enforcement, voluntary rescue units and emergency services if required.
Squally weather had prevented the IAF helicopters from sortieing into Idukki. They would carry out reconnaissance missions over the hilly district to identify landing spots and drop zones for relief and rescue operations.
The government had rushed battery packs, generators and inflatable light towers to the disaster-hit locality where emergency workers were sifting through the mud for trapped persons. Four billets with thirty rooms each got caught in the mudslide. At least 89 persons were missing. Rescue workers have retrieved 15 bodies. They have rushed several survivors to local hospitals. A blind spot
Mr. Vijayan said the disaster zone was a communication blind spot.
A collapsed bridge, fallen trees, inundated roads and threat of mudslides had impeded the rapid movement of rescue teams.
Power outage and rain storm damage had rendered the local mobile phone network dead. The government has rushed special medical teams to the spot. Inspector General of of Police Gopesh Agarwal was heading the rescue work at the disaster spot. Subscribe to Morning Filter & Evening Wrap newsletter Submit

"Search this site Detecting Depression Is being sad really bad? Nope! Sadness is a normal human emotion and isn’t really bad as we all assume. Sadness is just an outcome of an unfulfilled expectation, a disappointment, a separation, a failure or a loss. Sometimes, inability to handle (increasing) stress also leads to sadness. Actually, sadness saves a great amount of physical and mental energy by keeping an individual inactive, isolated and grounded over a short amount of time. The individual would need same energy in near future for re-starting to act or react upon something engaging and promising.Body language of a sad person speaks loudly to eyes of an observer. Such person appears detached from outer world and disinterested in what is happening around. Person’s body posture appear loose, crooked, saggy or requiring some king of physical support to keep body straight and upright. The outer edges of the person’s lips turn downward, focus is not maintained, no attention is given to others and no prolonged eye contact is made. Extreme expression of sadness is weeping and crying out loudly to seek immediate caressing, consoling and social support. Actually, a sad person seeks social support and stimulation to get rid of sadness. Motivation, hope, humor, promise, positivity and new opportunities drive away sadness and bring a person back in action, interaction and physical movements. In short, negative social stimulation(s) brings sadness and positive social stimulation(s) drives it away. However, depression can’t be driven away as easily as sadness. When sadness descends into deeper level of a person’s life for a prolonged time then it turns into depression. Unlike short-term sadness, depression is a mental disorder. It essentially disables a person. Severe and prolonged depression makes permanent damages to body, mind, brain and social rapport. Untreated acute depression (‘clinical depression’) can result in suicide. Hence, depression shouldn’t be taken lightly at all. What exactly leads to depression? Prolonged social isolation, childhood abuse, dysfunctional family, lack of a good company, guilt, lack of regular & positive social interactions, oppression, recurring failures, failed ambitions, deceased intimate person(s), broken heart, failed relationships, failed ventures, negative self-image, worthlessness, hopelessness, helplessness and most importantly - not being able to find any alternative way out of the ongoing personal condition i. e. chronic illness leads to depression. Malnutrition, deficiency, hormonal imbalance and heredity can also contribute to depression. Depression in a person can be detected through his/her body language, vocal, speech, behavioral and nonverbal clues which can’t at all remain hidden, suppressed or muted for a long time. Therefore, you should be able to detect depression in yourself and also in others to treat it effectively and timely to avoid devastating outcomes. Development of depression in older people is quite obvious due to deterioration, disabilities and deformations. However, falling prey to depression among adults, young men or women and children is increasing worldwide. Depression among children is a cures of modern life? Following are few key body language, vocal, speech, behavioral and nonverbal clues conveying depression:1) Person hardly makes any eye contact or avoids a prolonged one. Person buries his/her eyes into something, keeps eyes closed or keeps looking at something for a long time most. Dark circles could also develop around eyes. Person’s eyes lack luster, spark or shine. 2) Person’s cardiovascular capacity goes down significantly. Person breaths rapidly and pants heavily during seemingly routine and normal physical activities. Person experiences body pain and muscular weakness. Person suffers from frequent sickness and fatigue.3) Depression drains energy out of a person so such person’s overall body language i. e. facial expressions, hand gestures, vocal tone, gaze and body movements appear lacking esteem, passion, pride, coordination, flow, swag, speed, strength, spontaneity and firmness.4) Person remains silent, isolated and withdrawn for a long time. Person doesn’t want to exert himself/herself on anybody, doesn’t make his/her presence felt by others, doesn’t draw anybody’s attention or doesn’t take any active interest in interactions.5) Person’s doesn’t give enough attention to and takes care of his/her own physical appearance. Person doesn’t take care about how he/she looks in public. Person wears uncleaned and untidy cloths. Person lacks cleanliness and doesn’t care about hygiene.6) Person’s body postures appear dull, dented or downward. Person doesn’t stand upright, always seeks some physical support, doesn’t keep self straight and remains seated or laid down at one place for a very long time without saying or doing anything.7) Person can't focus or dedicate to on work life. Person wouldn't carry out given or self-assigned tasks and duties properly and timely. Procrastinating, yawning and telling excuse becomes routine for a depressed person. Work turns into punishment.8) Person appears demotivated, uncaring and disinterested to do, to carry, to perform, to act, to show or to repeat exactly what he/she once used to with a great interest, pride, energy and enthusiasm. 9) Person’s voice sounds low, heavy and filled with a great pain. Person speaks very slowly, takes a long time to complete words and also takes long pauses. Person doesn’t open up voluntarily. 10) Person doesn’t sleep well, deeply or calmly and eat appropriately. Person might eat a lot or very less. Person starts loosing appetite, vigor and libido.11) Person shows frequent and unpredictable mood swings through expressions, vocal tones and body movements. 12) Person indulges into serve addiction, drug abuse, self-abuse, self-harm and self-infliction. How to recognize a depressed person through verbal clues? Upon asking to share plans, thoughts, views, perspectives and opinions ; the depressed person often expresses irritation, negativity, lack of confidence, complaining, uncertainty, helplessness and anxiety . Basically, a depressed person feels as if nothing is left to contribute to world, society, community, family or group. Depression leads to decreased or no physical activities, lack of social interactions, bad eating habits, inability to focus, addiction and deteriorated health. Similarly, lack of physical activities, addiction, absence of good social interactions, bad nutrition, lack of great goals and diversion from healthy lifestyle can also contribute to depression. Spending hours with cellphone can be a sign of depression. Is our so-called modern, technological, intimacy-deprived, physically unchallenged, indoor, unbalanced and unnatural lifestyle the very reason behind increasing rate of minute to acute depression in population? NOW is the time to check and change. Related Articles:"
"Washington [US], August 7 (ANI): Former first lady of America , Michelle Obama has taken it to social media to assure her podcast audience that she is ""doing just fine"" following her opening up about ""dealing with some form of low-grade depression"" in this week's episode.
According to the People magazine, in the latest episode of her new podcast 'The Michelle Obama Podcast', she spoke with former NPR (National Public Radio) host Michele Norris about the ""emotional highs and lows"" of the past several months -- carrying topics from the pandemic, quarantine, protests against racism and more.
""Spiritually, these are not fulfilling times. So, I know that I am dealing with some form of low-grade depression,"" the magazine Quote: d Michelle as saying during the conversation.
Followed by this topic, the 56-year-old author hopped on to Instagram on late Thursday and assured her podcast listeners that she is ""doing just fine"" and there was no reason to worry about her, as many of her admirers constantly checked on her after the podcast session.
Sharing a black-and-white photo of herself journaling on the outdoors, the former first lady also noted that people should allow themselves to ""feel whatever it is you're feeling"" during the novel coronavirus pandemic, nationwide protests against police brutality, racism and elections.
""I just wanted to check in with you all because a lot of you have been checking in on me after hearing this week's podcast,"" Michelle wrote in the caption for the photo.

Kristen Wiig opens up about motherhood and undergoing IVF in a candid new interview for InStyle’s September subscriber cover.
The “ Saturday Night Live ” alum spoke with Editor-in-Chief Laura Brown about quarantining with her 9-month-old twins ― whom Wiig ultimately welcomed via surrogate ― and the “isolating experience” of trying IVF for three years.
Wiig said that she and her fiancé, Avi Rothman, have been essentially self-isolating with their children since January.
“We’re nesting, and we’re tired. Having two 9-month-olds is a lot!” the comedian said. “But they’re growing, and I can’t wait to see them every morning. It’s not all just lying around and smiling at babies, though.”
It was a long journey to get to the babies, as the “Bridesmaids” star said that she and her partner went through a three-year, IVF-induced “haze” trying to conceive.
“Emotionally, spiritually, and medically, it was probably the most difficult time in my life. I wasn’t myself,” Wiig said.
“There are so many emotions that go with it — you’re always waiting by the phone and getting test results, and it was just bad news after bad news. Occasionally there would be a good month, but then it was just more bad news. There was a lot of stress and heartache.”
While Wiig said she wished she had opened up about IVF more, she “stopped talking about it entirely” in her own circle, “because I would get sad whenever someone asked. It was just part of my life.”
“It can be the most isolating experience,” she added.
Prior to confirming she and Rotham, who got engaged in August 2019, had welcomed twins earlier this year, the “Ghostbusters” actor hinted at motherhood during a guest appearance on “SNL.”
“I don’t know if I truly appreciated my mom the first 45 years of my life,” Wiig said during a Mother’s Day episode released during quarantine.
“But this year I’m feeling especially grateful for her advice, her love,” she continued. “I’m so thankful for all the things she’s taught me, preparing me to be a mom myself.” Head over to InStyle to read more of Wiig’s interview. RELATED…

America Could Have 'Great Depression' Levels of Homelessness by Year's End Next

As many as 40 million Americans could face eviction by the end of the year if the federal government doesn’t come up with significant financial assistance and tenant protections, according to research published Friday.
A cadre of researchers from Wake Forest University, the Aspen Institute, the Eviction Lab at Princeton University, the National Low Income Housing Coalition, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and others analyzed Census data, unemployment numbers, eviction filing projections, and information on housing insecurity to conclude that some 30 million to 40 million Americans could soon be at risk for eviction due to the massive job and income losses in the pandemic. That would envelop anywhere from 29% to 43% of all renter households in America, the researchers wrote.
In some states, including Mississippi and Louisiana, more than half of all renter households could be at risk, according to the research.
Housing advocates and researchers have warned of this impending crisis for months, since it could have widespread economic implications, create a new wave of poverty, and stoke a rise in homelessness, particularly among Black and brown Americans. Kids will be harmed too. According to separate data published by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities this week, more than 1 in 4 children live in a home that’s currently behind on housing payments, can’t get enough to eat, or both.
Two key provisions that have helped renters stay in their homes over the past few months — a moratorium on evicting tenants from federally backed properties, and an extra $600 weekly benefit for unemployed workers — expired last month.
Now, negotiations on another relief package to extend those benefits appear to be at a standstil l, with President Donald Trump threatening to restore the federal eviction protections and expanded unemployment benefits by executive order. But even that extension may not be enough, researchers wrote in their report. The “most comprehensive policy proposals” include both a nationwide moratorium on evictions from almost all rental housing and at least $100 billion in emergency rental assistance, mirroring two bills that the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed earlier this year.
Those proposals have so far gone nowhere in a Republican-controlled Senate, although some conservatives are starting to warm to the idea of more tailored relief programs.
“Without a significant and sustained federal intervention, America will experience an increase in homelessness the likes of which we haven’t seen since the Great Depression,” Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said in a statement.“Allowing tens of millions of people to lose their homes during a pandemic is cruel and senseless: Evictions risk lives, drive families deeper into poverty, and make it much more difficult for the country to contain the virus.”
“Evictions risk lives, drive families deeper into poverty, and make it much more difficult for the country to contain the virus.”
States, cities, and even the federal government had reacted to a looming housing crisis at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic by creating eviction moratoriums to ensure newly unemployed renters wouldn’t be taken to court for non-payment. Even before the pandemic, many tenants were just one disaster away from homelessness, since nearly nearly 11 million households put more than half their income toward rent each month, the researchers wrote Friday.
But those protections are quickly disappearing; more than half of all states lack such moratoriums.
The plight of renters will weigh on property owners, too.
If landlords can’t cover lost rental payments out of their own pockets or through credit, they’ll face foreclosure and bankruptcy, disrupting an already strained market for affordable housing. What’s more, that stock could become particularly vulnerable to private equity investment, similar to what happened after the 2008 financial crisis, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and California activist Carroll Fife said in a Washington Post op-ed Friday. Previous
“Red Penguins” Chronicles The Russian Partnership With An NHL Franchise Next

The sport of hockey, at least in the United States, didn’t always have the Russian influence that it now has. There was a time where players from the former Soviet Union first came over to American shores and started in the NHL. Filmmaker Gabe Polsky has looked at that before, but for his latest documentary, he’s chronicling a period where an NHL franchise actually went to Russia and tried to save their sport over there. The result is Red Penguins, a unique and entertaining doc that only falls a bit short when it attempts to be overly important at the end. Out now, it’s a quality flick that shines a light on a story you almost certainly were unaware of.
This film, as you might imagine, is a sports documentary about the incredible true partnership between Russia and the Pittsburgh Penguins. Not long after the collapse of the Soviet Union, an NHL franchise in the Penguins and the famed Red Army hockey team formed a joint venture together. Capitalism was obviously at the center of it, but also an attempt to show that anything was possible in the new Russia. Penguins owner Howard Baldwin sends his top marketing guy in Steve Warshaw to Russia with the heavy task of transforming the team into an entertaining and profitable show. As Warshaw comes up with events that includes trippers and live bears serving beer on the rink, gangsters rear their head. Ultimately, it becomes a look at a strange moment in U.S. and Russian relations during this time, as oligarchs began to make their fortunes and eventually multiple murders were committed. Polsky directs the doc, with music from Leo Birenberg and cinematography by Alexey Elagin.
There’s something about this movie that almost recalls a studio comedy. Obviously, Greg Polsky was attracted to the lunacy involved in bringing sports marketing to a Russian hockey club, and it comes off clearly in the production. The doc has more than its fair share of crazy stories, often involving the eccentric oddball that is Steve Warshaw. A lot of the best moments are tales being recounted to the screen via talking heads, which is a shame considering what some of the available images and videos shown in the film are, but that’s to be expected. It’s no surprise that Disney was looking to get into bed with the Penguins on this venture, since it shares so much with what could be a zany sports flick.
Red Penguins is a lot of fun, but when the final act leans in to the dangers of the Russian mob, as well as trying to tie together the collapse of the venture with the ultimate rise of Vladimir Putin, it begins to bite off more than it can chew. Sure, the mob stuff is important, if tonally at odds with the rest of the documentary, but it’s an essential part of the story. The final moments, however, go a little too far and have a self-important nature that’s at odds with the rest of the doc. It’s not a huge issue, but it ends things on a slightly sour note.
Today, hockey fans, history buffs, and documentary lovers can all come together and enjoy Red Penguins, the sort of true story you’d never believe was actually true, if not for a film being made. The stories and unique personalities on display alone are worth the price of admission. Anyone who loves a good sports doc will find plenty to like here. The movie, minus its small flaws, is a real treat.
Be sure to check out Red Penguins, out now!

Karwai Tang/Getty Images Actress and singer Selena Gomez said pandemic lockdown measures have been negatively affecting her mental health during an interview to promote her new show Selena + Chef. In April, Gomez revealed that she'd been recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder . The ""Lose You to Love Me"" singer said support from friends and therapy have helped ""keep her mind positive."" Actress and singer Selena Gomez recently revealed that, like so many other Americans , pandemic lockdown has negatively impacted her mental health.
Her comments come after sharing in early April that she'd been diagnosed with bipolar disorder , a mental health condition that can cause emotional highs, or mania, and emotional lows, or depression.
""It's not easy for anyone to be walking through what we're walking through. It's not normal, and it's affecting people, specifically with mental health, and people who could have never thought about things they're thinking about now. And it's really confusing,"" Gomez said during a WarnerMedia's virtual Television Critics Association press tour. Advertisement"
"Sunlight can have many benefits for your health – just make sure to wear sunscreen. Peter Cade/Getty Images Small doses of sun exposure can provide health benefits, such as boosting mood and increasing vitamin D production. For most people, 10 to 15 minutes of sun exposure a day is enough to receive these health benefits. To prevent sun damage and minimize health risks, you should wear broad spectrum sunscreen daily with at least an SPF of 30. This article was medically reviewed by Benjamin Bert, MD , an ophthalmologist at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California . Sunlight is often perceived as a threat to your health because it can cause wrinkles, premature aging, and most importantly, skin cancer . But, research suggests exposure to sunlight may actually be beneficial in small doses.
Here are a few ways sunlight positively affects your body and brain, and how much sun you should get to receive these health benefits.
1. Sunlight boosts mood Scientists have found that sunlight may affect the central nervous system's functioning — primarily in regards to serotonin levels. Advertisement Serotonin is a neurotransmitter and hormone secreted by the hypothalamus that allows brain cells and other nervous system cells to communicate with one another. It plays various roles in our sleep and eating habits , but it's perhaps best known for its effect on mood stabilization, feelings of well-being, and overall happiness .
Because sunlight helps the body release serotonin , during periods of the year when sunlight is less available — like in winter — the hypothalamus produces less serotonin from sunlight. This can put people at an increased risk of experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety , possibly leading to conditions like Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). Advertisement SAD, or seasonal depression , is a mood disorder that manifests during fall and winter months. Those who experience SAD usually see their symptoms of depression improve come spring and summer with more daylight hours. One of the ways the disorder is treated is with artificial light , as the practice is believed to boost serotonin levels.
2. Sunlight increases vitamin D production Sunlight serves a crucial role in the body's production of vitamin D, which has many health benefits . Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium, as well as to mineralize. Mineralization describes the formation of bone matrix , which makes bones strong and rigid. Sunlight is the primary way people get vitamin D.A common misconception is that sunlight actually contains vitamin D. In fact, UV rays in sunlight stimulate the skin to produce the substance. Advertisement Research has shown that maintaining adequate amounts of vitamin D may protect you from developing multiple sclerosis and various forms of cancers including ovarian , breast , and prostate.
It is important to note these studies all found correlations, not causations in the connection between vitamin D and cancer. Therefore, there is no guarantee that adequate amounts of the sunshine vitamin will prevent cancer.
Further, using sunscreen daily will not eliminate the amount of vitamin D benefits offered by the sun. Advertisement 3. Sunlight may prevent nearsightedness Research suggests children who spend more time in sunlight may be less likely to become nearsighted. A 2012 review published by the American Academy of Ophthalmology found that for each hour children up to the age of 20 spent outdoors, the odds of developing nearsightedness fell 2%.
Christopher Starr , MD, an ophthalmologist at Weill Cornell Medical College , says kids should spend an additional one to three hours a day outside, to stimulate dopamine production. Lack of dopamine causes elongation of the eye, resulting in nearsightedness. However, exposure to sunlight does not seem to reverse the effects on kids who are already nearsighted.
4. Sunlight can help you sleep Sunlight plays a pivotal role in regulating our internal clock . This clock, otherwise known as circadian rhythm, dictates our behavior based on time of day — like when to fall asleep, wake up, or eat. Light appears to be one of the main driving forces behind this clock. Advertisement Through a process called entrainment, a person's circadian rhythm needs to reset every day in order to stay synced with changes in light. This can occur because of changing seasons or moving to a new time zone. Research indicates entrainment takes place as a result of exposure to light and darkness. Regular exposure to sunlight trains your brain to sleep when it becomes dark, and as a result, it can help you get a better night's sleep.
How much sunlight should you get? According to Adam Friedman , MD, professor and interim chair of dermatology at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, it's difficult to determine a standard amount of time one should spend soaking up the rays to ensure adequate vitamin D production. Advertisement For many people, 10 to 15 minutes of sun exposure per day is enough. However, the length of time will vary widely due to factors like skin color , elevation , and how close you are to the equator.
In much of the US — that is anywhere roughly north of Arizona — the skin produces trivial amounts of vitamin D during fall, winter, and spring. Meanwhile, people over the age of 65 produce just 25%of the vitamin D that young adults do. Black people also do not make as much vitamin D , as darker skin pigmentation reduces production. Therefore, Friedman recommends people who fall into the above demographics take vitamin D supplements. The standard dose for adults under the age of 70 is 600 international units (IU) a day. Advertisement In rare cases, taking too much vitamin D can lead to toxicity called hypervitaminosis D, which can lead to renal and cardiac problems.
Too much sunlight can be harmful Spending too much time in the sun can be harmful to your health. Even the mildest sunburn is considered a skin injury. Other skin conditions like hyperpigmentation, wrinkles, and sun spots are also caused by too much UV radiation.
Of course, these concerns are far from just cosmetic. Skin cancer, often caused by harmful ultraviolet radiation, is the most common form of cancer in the US with more than 9,500 people diagnosed every day . This is why it's important to wear sunscreen regardless of how much time you spend in the sun. Advertisement"
"Hatha yoga focuses on asanas, or poses. Catherine Delahaye/Getty Images The benefits of Hatha yoga include better sleep, strengthening core muscles, improving depression symptoms, and helping with stress management. Hatha yoga is a type of yoga that emphasizes holding poses for long periods of time. It is made up of three main practices: body postures, breathing techniques, and meditation. This article was reviewed by Joey Thurman , CSCS, CPT, FNS, a Chicago-based fitness expert and MYX Fitness coach. Hatha yoga is a form of yoga that involves holding specific body postures, called asanas, to work on muscle strength and connect your mind with your body.
Hatha is one of the most popular types of yoga practiced in the US and research shows that it has been linked to mental and physical health benefits like stress management and stronger core muscles .
Here's what you need to know about Hatha yoga and how it can benefit your physical and mental health. Advertisement What is hatha yoga? The word Hatha means ""discipline of force"" in Sanskrit , and the goal of Hatha yoga is to strengthen your muscles and create a mindful connection to your body. Hatha yoga is actually an umbrella term that refers to any yoga practice that uses the common yoga postures you may have encountered in a yoga class, like downward-facing dog or child's pose. You can see examples of Hatha yoga poses here .
However, if you go to a yoga class labeled ""Hatha"" in the US, you will usually find that it emphasizes holding poses for long periods, as opposed to classes like Vinyasa yoga that move more quickly and fluidly through poses. Advertisement According to Neha Gothe, PhD , director of the Exercise Psychology Lab at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Hatha yoga is made up of three main practices:
Body postures (asanas) Breathing techniques (pranayama) Relaxation and meditation (dyana) In a Hatha yoga class, you may learn about different ways of controlling your breath or how to sit in meditation in addition to doing yoga poses. ""Yoga began as a spiritual practice, but it has become popular as a way of promoting physical and mental well-being,"" Gothe says. You may know that yoga can help tone muscles and make you more flexible, but there are many other health benefits you can get from practicing Hatha yoga. Advertisement Here are some of the health benefits to your mind and body that you can get from regularly practicing Hatha yoga:
1. Hatha yoga strengthens your core muscles Doing Hatha yoga poses like plank pose and warrior I pose can help strengthen your core muscles , which include the muscles in your abdomen, sides, pelvis, and back.
Core muscles are important for overall body function since strong core muscles can help prevent lower back pain , improve your balance , and make you less likely to have a muscle injury . Advertisement Yoga can also be a good option for people who want to strengthen their core but can't do higher intensity exercises like running or weight lifting, such as older adults or people with certain disabilities, Gothe says.
Hatha yoga strengthens your core muscles because it requires holding poses for long periods of time, which activates muscles like your abdominals and glutes. Some of these strengthening poses include:
Boat pose Crystal Cox/BI Photo Advertisement Boat pose can activate your frontal abdominal muscles. Side plank Crystal Cox/BI Photos
Side plank strengthens your oblique muscles. Advertisement Bridge pose Crystal Cox/BI Photo
Bridge pose tones your back and glutes. 2. Hatha yoga helps you get a better night's sleep Doing Hatha yoga can reduce your levels of cortisol , a hormone that is tied to your sleep cycle . Low cortisol levels signal to your body that it's time to sleep , so doing yoga before bed can help you fall asleep more quickly. Advertisement Some experts believe that yoga also benefits sleep because it emphasizes mindful breathing and meditation, which can help relax your mind and body before heading to bed.
A review published in 2013 in Frontiers in Psychiatry looked at three small studies on the effect of yoga on sleeping patterns. The studies used different time periods of yoga practices — some yoga classes went on for as little as 7 weeks while others continued for 6 months.
The research found that in all studies, doing yoga helped people fall asleep faster and improved their overall quality of sleep . Advertisement 3. Hatha yoga may improve depression symptoms Experts believe that Hatha yoga helps ease depression because it acts on the neurotransmitters in your brain in a similar way to antidepressants .
For example, doing yoga increases the levels of neurotransmitters like serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in your brain. GABA calms your nervous system and can help soothe anxious feelings brought on by depression, while serotonin helps to regulate your emotions .
The same 2013 review in Frontiers in Psychiatry looked at four small studies on how Hatha yoga affects depression symptoms. Results showed that people who did yoga once a week for as few as 5 weeks reported significantly lower scores on surveys measuring depression. Advertisement"
"Kolkata: The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested the second accused person in connection with the suicide of BJP MLA of Hemtabad in North Dinajpur, Debendranath Roy, on Friday evening from Mothabari area in Malda.
Roy's body was found hanging outside a shop near his residence on July 13 morning. During investigation, the police had recovered a suicide note where he had mentioned names of two persons — Nilay Sinha and Mahbud Ali — and held them responsible for his death.
After preliminary investigations, the cops came to know that Roy used to work in a bank at Muhimganj and had come in touch with Sinha for the first time in 2016. Sinha had even stayed in a rented room in the MLA's house. Six to seven months ago, the MLA had planned to set up a rice mill as he was also into the business of Tulaipanji rice. Police suspect that Roy had somehow managed to collect around Rs 1.37 crore from the bank where he used to worked. He also collected some money from his close ones and handed over around Rs 1.5 crore to Sinha and Ali to set up the rice mill. But the project did not materialise and it led to depression as he failed to clear his debts.
Two days after the suicide, the probe was handed over to the CID following which Sinha was arrested from English Bazar area in Malda.
But Ali continued to evade arrest since Roy's body was found.
On Friday evening, Malda police were tipped off about Ali in Mothabari area. Police tracked him down and detained him. Sources informed that he has been brought to Raigunj and handed over to the CID later in the evening. "

"As the debate over social taboo on discussing mental health issues is growing and experts emphasise on correct usage of words when describing the act of suicide, is it correct for studios like Rocksteadys to title game Suicide Squads? Aug 8, 2020 03:21 IST Twitter
In terms of communication and marketing, an editor or a filmmaker understands the power of words and visuals used to entice the audience. They select texts and pictures which they think can pull in a maximum number of audience to their project. So far nothing wrong. But what about the usage of certain words, like suicide, that contentiously triggers a harmful attribute in people? Is it correct to use such words even then?
Rocksteady announces a new DC game: Suicide Squad
As the news about the new DC game by Rocksteady, Suicide Squad, was announced today, the term started to trend in upward of 40 thousand. Well, almost all the mention of the term in tweets were related to the game, it also spiked a concern about those with suicidal tendency and how the word ""Suicide Squad"" would impact such people.
There is much debate going on the issue of mental health and suicides after a spate of deaths of some well-known personalities in recent times. Celebrities like Kate Spade, chef Anthony Bourdain in the US last year, and actor Sushant Singh Rajput, his ex-manager Disha Salian, and two Bollywood and Bhojpuri actors dying by suicide recently steered the common consciousness of the society towards the topics like mental illness and suicide. — Rocksteady Studios (@RocksteadyGames) August 7, 2020
Growing discussion on mental health issues and suicide
The social taboo associated with depression and other mental illness has long distanced people with such issues to talk about it much less get the treatment for it, forcing them to suffer in isolation. It is only when they take the extreme step that people around them notice it. But now as the focus on mental health is gradually increasing, more research is also being done to figure out what triggers people to take such an extreme step.
What triggers people to take the extreme step
Though there could be many factors that can lead a person to think about taking his or her own life, experts say that it's mainly some sort of trigger that pushes them to take the extreme measure. Sushant Singh Rajput died by suicide on june 14 Instagram
It could be casually spoken words like ""kill me"", ""shoot me"", or gestures using hand like a gun, or words used in describing in the killing of oneself like ""committed suicide"", copy cat death , etc have been reported as triggers capable of pushing people to take extreme steps.
For example, according to one report, a Netflix show 13 Reasons Why , and an online game Blue Whale provoked many young boys and girls to take their life because the characters or the tasks in it pushed them to do such acts.
In these times, when people are spending more time online than interacting with real people, it is quite understandable that some of them would be heavily influenced by the online content and others might feel trapped there because in the real world they don't find enough encouragement to talk about their mental health issue.
Language matters
It is because of this, various health agencies have asked journalists to exercise caution when describing death by suicide instead of calling it ""committed suicide."" Netflix was forced to edit the controversial suicide scene from acclaimed teen drama, 13 Reasons Why after news of a rise in suicides among young people in the US. Courtesy: Netflix
Health experts explain that the word ""committed"" signifies the culpability of the person who took the step as if he had the option of doing otherwise. On the contrary, such a person takes that drastic step because he/she feels that that was the only resort. And the last thing we ever should do is to blame the person who was so in despair that he took the step.
As have been reported in several cases that till the last day victims' family or friend couldn't gauge that the person was going through mental health issues and after they take the extreme step, they came to know, it makes it incumbent upon us to practice precaution when using such words that can invariably cause distress to people suffering from suicidal thoughts.

"An approved coronavirus vaccine could end up being effective only 50 to 60 percent of the time, meaning public health measures will still be needed to keep the pandemic under control, Dr Anthony Fauci, the top United States infectious diseases expert, said on Friday. “We don’t know yet what the efficacy might be. We don’t know if it will be 50 percent or 60 percent. I’d like it to be 75 percent or more,” Fauci said in a webinar hosted by Brown University. “But the chances of it being 98 percent effective is not great, which means you must never abandon the public health approach.” The novel coronavirus has infected nearly five million people in the US and killed more than 160,000.
Lockdown measures imposed to keep the virus from spreading have devastated the economy, which suffered its biggest blow since the Great Depression in the second quarter, with gross domestic product dropping at its steepest pace in at least 73 years. Dr Anthony Fauci says studies of Moderna Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine could produce definitive data in November or December of this year [Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters]
As infections have spiked around the country after states started to open up, public health experts, including Fauci, have stressed the importance of steps that each American can take, including social distancing, washing hands and wearing masks.
Fauci said on Friday that studies of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine could produce definitive data in November or December of this year.
He said earlier this week that he expects tens of millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses to be available by early 2021, and a billion doses by the end of that year.
US President Donald Trump has put forward a more optimistic forecast, saying on Thursday that the country could have a coronavirus vaccine before the November 3 election. SOURCE: "

To successfully distance yourself from the prevalent norms of society, that with every passing breath from childhood aspires to instil in you every single grain of prejudice possible, is a herculean task that cannot be accomplished without support.
Being born in a middle-class Rajput family was not a choice I made. As a child in his own innocent blissful world, I enjoyed basking in the glorious orbs of my Ma’s jewellery and sarees. Unlike boys my age, speeding and force were never my gaming zones. The tenderness and beauty of dolls often lured me into playing with them, dressing them up as gorgeously as Nani would find me, with those heavy, dark locks and big, round eyes of mine that shimmered in the attire of a bride.
Dressing up as the dulhan in the ‘dulha-dulhan’ game, wearing Masi’s dupatta as a hairpiece and dancing wholeheartedly without a shred of care for the world on Madhuri Dixit’s Bollywood numbers opened the non-negotiable realm of society for me .
While growing up, I did not have a particularly friendly relationship with my father. Like most dad-son bonds, ours was speckled with shades of masculinity where the proclamation of love and expression of feelings lay suppressed. To make a man out of his effeminate son (whose walk and words resonated with feminine tenderness rather than manly toughness), Papa would relentlessly beat me for even the smallest of mistakes.
He detested my speaking Bhojpuri, our mother tongue, as he felt it made me sound like a ‘mauga’ (a Bhojpuri word for effeminacy). I never quite knew the amiable side of parenting for the most part of my childhood, it surfaced only in certain instances when Ma was around. However, her working in a different district often stole this bit of happiness away.
Where on one side, home had this to offer, school only worsened my mental peace and added to the trauma of ‘being different’.

Known to be a space where one’s identity is formed, where our personalities are shaped, school contributed in making me known as ‘ chakka , hijra ‘ (insults for eunuchs and trans persons), words which were thrown like daggers at me in the most derogatory sense.
The notion of your name reflecting as your identity became a blurred idea for me. There are very few days of my school life when I was not bullied or humiliated. Hence, it’s hard to forget the rest – which had become ‘my normal’ for not being normal.
An incident etched clearly in my mind was when a classmate sitting behind me wrote ‘SIXER’ (an abuse for queer people) with paint on my shirt. The courage and strength that I had been mustering all this while, which had been secretly helping me tackle each day as it came, lay shattered.
I tried every possible way to stop going to school again, one time even intentionally hurting my own leg, but it nothing worked.
For once, after years, I let down my shield of masculinity and cried in the warm and secure arms of Ma, cursing my birth and existence. The torment of years could not be calmed with her wise words. So, taking the onus on herself to set it all right, she spoke to my class teacher about all that had been going on.
This only worsened things. Everyone at school stopped talking to me. My existence was now even smaller than before.
After matriculation, I took admission in humanities in a different school. My idiotic heart, which clings to every false hope, led me into believing that this change would mark a new beginning of acceptance, kindness and warmth. Little did I know that the humanities can only teach such notions, but cannot force you to practice them.

All my aspirations to be known as ‘Aditya’ in this new setting, among new people, got burnt at the playground as the sun beat down on us when a boy from my previous school called out to me, “Chakka, tu yahan!”
I decided not to succumb this time, so the ‘new me’ did not let them humiliate me to my face. But that did not stop it from happening behind my back.
To exist equally was now forgotten. The exuberance and flamboyancy of my personality now lay boxed. Insecure in my own skin, I started to feel suffocated in my own body and more than once considered ending it all only to hate myself for not having the courage to fully follow through with such a step.
I started keeping to myself, an introvert who only found the will to breathe in the reality of his own identity either through comic books, TV series or movies. At times, I danced in front of the mirror, in my dad’s dhoti wrapped around as a gaghra (skirt) to feel free. It never felt as liberating, for the doors were always locked and loneliness was my only audience.
But sometimes, the process of change is not noticeable to the naked eye, nor is the human brain intelligent enough to register it until the change is visible outwardly. §
Standing on stage in a long yellow skirt, resonating my faith in blurred gender roles and a belief in masculinity beyond the idea of clothing, in a packed auditorium, I was not only accepting the award for topping the second year of college – the moment came as a realisation of how the past few years in Delhi University’s Ramjas College had empowered me to accept myself the way I am, to love myself and to believe the notion that only the sky was the limit.
This acceptance did not enter my system overnight, but was a process of constant unlearning of what society had enforced ever since birth. It was learning to put my individuality beyond the flawed spectrum of prejudices and stereotypes.
To say that it was a cakewalk to reach this stage in my life, that would be a lie.
For my three years of college, I stayed in the Ramjas hostel for boys. Initially, it was tough to be surrounded by men who questioned my manhood and masculinity in every action, and it made me feel vulnerable. But the beautiful course I was enrolled in helped me understand the fragility of masculinity. The constant load and pressure it puts upon men ‘to become a man’; to be conditioned as insensitive creatures and to avoid all discussions and talk about normalised oppression – as it would manifest their ‘unseen, unknown side of femininity’.

Understanding this helped soothe my anger towards my father. It helped me see his concern for his son. And, being a product of his times, I realised he had simply given into the methods his father used to bring him up.
Of late, I have been vocal about my feelings. This has mended our bond. Delhi, in all its colours, brought with it some angels in the form of the most understanding humans in my life. Without their support and irrevocable faith in me, I would have never dared to take such a big leap from the side of constant insecurity and loathing to undeterred belief in myself to become whoever I wanted to be.
With time and maturity, I can now even comprehend the strength and beauty of my sexual orientation. I am a gay person who happens to fall for the wrong men – always. To love them has always felt like ‘we’ have never belonged to this tangible place, neither do our hearts, and yet, here we are, making love as we make love to life with no strings attached. This tantalising fragrance of love with the same-sex has ephemerality and the strength of petrichor – intense, but short.
Every time I have fallen in love, I have had a different experience, just like the varied spectrum of sexuality. Still, one thing that has been common to all is how easily a man can accept his vulnerability behind locked doors; how everyone is a little gay or has a ‘gayish’ side to them that can be hidden well behind a façade. But to portray it boldly is to bathe in the joy of a unicorn ride over a rainbow slide.
Aditya Singh is a 22-year-old who identifies as a gay person. He has led 22 years of his life like a turtle, carrying the load of societal norms and prejudices and now finally, he has reached the finish line of self loathe and depression beyond which lies acceptance and love studded among glimmering stars, unicorns and rainbows.

"The Centre&apos;s decision to appoint Manoj Sinha as the Lieutenant Governor of Jammu & Kashmir is being perceived as a master stroke. He has been sent as a catalyst for restoring the political process. But he has a daunting task of winning people&apos;s hearts before he is able to achieve the Government&apos;s objectives.
In his new challenging role, Sinha is not just expected to mend roads in Srinagar but also to connect political highways with the political dispensation at the Centre. He has good credentials. He has good equations with both PM Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah as well. He is an experienced and sophisticated leader.
One of his biggest qualifications for the job is that he enjoys good relations with politicians in Kashmir including the Abdullahs. Green shoots have already started emerging with the release of almost all political detainees except Mehbooba Mufti and a few others, who continue to choose to go the primrose way and toe the separatist line.
Sinha, it is believed, is capable of preparing fertile ground for political activity. But he has to reorient the system and prepare it for the political activities to grow organically. Vice-president of NC Omar Abdullah has said that he would not contest elections until statehood is restored. Sinha&apos;s initial task would be to test the waters for restoration of the statehood, as promised by PM Modi.
Today Kashmiris are a confused lot. Having experienced the process of Abrogation of Article 370, they will now have to decide whether to align with the government, take the middle path or go the separatist way. Immediately after taking oath as LG, Sinha&apos;s statement was quite positive.
He said it&apos;s time to connect Jammu & Kashmir to the mainstream. He will inspire confidence among the people and ensure there is no discrimination. And that he will be guided by Indian Constitution. He will work for the well-being and development of the region. Genuine grievances of people would be addressed and solutions will be worked out. ""Hum seedha samvad karenge,""(Will interact with people directly), he said while addressing the media in Srinagar on Friday.
One of his most important tasks would include rehabilitation of Kashmiri pandits in the valley. At the moment one could only visualise their return but the actual return would depend on how soon the political process is restored.
A political vacuum over a long span of time could be detrimental to national interests and would only benefit separatist backed by Pakistan. Inimical neighbors have been aggressively carrying out its anti -India agenda on international forums without any success though. It has to be quelled by expediting the political process.
Challenges are many, even after getting significant and unprecedented support from the people of Kashmir ground workers have been targeted by terrorists. Sajad Ahmad Khanday, a BJP leader, who was a sarpanch in Jammu & Kashmir&apos;s Kulgam district was shot dead by terrorists a few days ago. Last month BJP Chief of Bandipore Sheikh Waseem Bari, his father and brother were killed in the district. This and a series of many other killings have spread fear among the political workers. This must be stopped if actual democracy is to prevail there.
Therefore there is some urgency that the political process should be restored at the earliest. LG Sinha is expected to bring political parties to a convergence point, which is acceptable to all. This of course will take time and will require patience if BJP were to succeed in its long cherished objectives.
Having served as threetime Member of Parliament and as successful Union minister of telecom and railways with independent charge at the Centre, Sinha is being seen as an apt choice for building on tough efforts undertaken during last one year.
Also the choice is being perceived as appropriate due to his calm temperament and his image as a problem solver. Sinha is an engineer from Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University- so he could also be described as a technocrat.
Abrogation of Article 370 had been one of the most important highlights of BJP&apos;s manifesto. It was implemented one year ago. A whole lot of painstaking security planning and meticulous execution of the plan was put in place. All possible fallouts were taken into account and nobody got a whiff that the Centre had actually made up its mind to implement it until it made the formal announcement. This planning and seamless execution was unprecedented in terms of its success and effectiveness in achieving the government&apos;s initial objectives.
The state of Jammu & Kashmir without any major violence was bifurcated into two union territories J&K and Ladakh. Following the abrogation, the Prime Minister Modi in his address to the nation had promised that there would be a window for restoration of statehood and J&K would be run by the elected representatives.
Ever since the government&apos;s priority was in stage 1 — to pronounce strategies aimed at empowering people through economic incentives, public and private investment and providing employment to youths. While some efforts were made in this direction despite the inertia of the state&apos;s reluctant bureaucracy not much could be achieved.
Another reason was the security lock-down followed by Corona lock-down, which halted all developmental activities envisaged by the Centre. Corona had ensured that even the rest of the country went into lock-down like Jammu & Kashmir. But for the people of J&K it was much tougher and intense as they came to terms with the shocking changes in the political set up as well.
Long span of lockdown has set in depression in the minds of people. School children have been hardly able to go to school for days in one whole year. Businesses and livelihood have taken a major hit like never before. All developmental work has come to a halt.
While all this happened most political leaders were detained as a security requirement. Consequently people could not reach out to their leaders for resolving the issues. The new administrative set up was busy charting a way forward for implementing the ambitious schemes announced by the government and at the same time battling with a severe strain of Covid-19.
These days the political vacuum is most intense and dangerous. Some political activity started with Altaf Bukhari forming the Apni Party as an alternative to PDP, NC and Congress. It was a welcome move but due to a long lull in political activity, reluctance has set in the leaders of the newly formed party as well.
Manoj Sinha has been introduced into Stage 2- a crucial juncture-which is the advanced process of restoring the political process. Now let&apos;s look at the rationale behind his appointment. He was one of the contenders for the post of chief minister in Uttar Pradesh so he has a big stature and good rapport with the top BJP leadership.
He has an advantage which LG G C Murmu did not enjoy. It is the advantage of his political acumen and getting things done by the bureaucracy with a certain authority. The bureaucracy has no option but to fall in line with the experienced leader.
Ever since the process of abrogation of Article 370 began, every Centre representative had played an important role. While Satya Pal Malik, who is also an experienced politician was entrusted with the responsibility of governance in the initial phase of abrogation of Article 370, G C Murmu a non-controversial bureaucrat was brought in to bring in administrative changes aimed at the development in the region. He now enjoys one of the most coveted bureaucratic appointments of the CAG.
It is ironic that despite best of his efforts in Kashmir, circumstances were such that he could not achieve much success. The people of Srinagar were appreciative of his genuine efforts including his decision of allocation for funds for building roads. Murmu was instrumental to some extent to bring normalcy in the administration. Perhaps he could have performed better if he got more support.
Manoj Sinha, who is multifaceted and enjoys the reputation of a leader with sharp political thinking, a technocrat and a sophisticated person who can get along with everybody, has been entrusted with his own set of responsibilities. So he has all the qualities required for the position — an experienced politician, a technocrat and an able administrator.
In order to be successful in his new endeavor, Sinha will have to do a tightrope walk. His journey in Jammu and Kashmir may be fraught with the risk of creating a Jagmohan like image for himself. Jagmohan had a good first stint as J&K Governor in the eighties. His term was by and large peaceful. But Kashmiri people have bitter memories of him when he returned to the position again in the 1990s, the time when terrorists started getting support from people in a big way. His reputation as a well-meaning person and an able administrator took a dent in his second term while he was busy with the law and order compulsions.
It is now in the interest of people of Jammu & Kashmir to cooperate with Manoj Sinha who has started on a positive note. Terrorism will not lead to anywhere. Now that the people have come to terms with the fact that abrogation of Article 370 is irrevocable they should work hand-in-hand with the new LG for a bright future.
Jammu & Kashmir has great potential for growth. The people of the region have shown it in the past with its high growth rate. Now that J&K stands on the threshold of entering the mainstream enjoying all the joys and sorrow that any other Indian citizen experiences, people of the region need to come out of the clutches of Pakistan and make a new beginning.
The post Manoj Sinha has a tightrope walk ahead in Kashmir appeared first on The Daily Guardian.

"The family of actor and model Sameer Sharma, 44, arrived in the city from Bangalore on Friday and recorded their statements with the police. Meanwhile, sources said that police have found a medical file which will be closely checked to ascertain if the late actor was consulting any specialist and had any ailments. Sharma, who was found hanging from the ceiling fan on Wednesday night, had mostly stayed alone in the flat and had no visitors since he shifted at the rental Malad apartment in February, said police.
Sharma was staying in a rented apartment at Neha CHS near Jankalyan Nagar in Malad (W), where he is suspected to have committed suicide three days ago. According to police sources, when the building&apos;s watchman saw Sharma hanging from the kitchen ceiling, he alerted the residents and broke the door open, only to find the house in a very untidy position with liquor bottles spread all over, hinting that he had been drinking days before his drastic step.
Interestingly, during the panchnama, police also found a heavy medical file, which will be closely monitored to ascertain if Sharma was recently diagnosed with any ailments. Meanwhile, police have recorded statements of Sharma&apos;s family-- parents and sister, who have reportedly said that the actor kept in touch with them, but not very often.
Police will also be recording statements of any actor/friends who were acquainted with Sharma to find any leads on the reason for his suicide. While Sharma was separated from his wife and had filed for divorce, police suspect family issues were not the trigger for committing the suicide. Malad Police will also be going through Sharma&apos;s financials and social media.
According to sources, Sharma hardly had any visitors at his house and was mostly by himself during the lockdown. One of Sharma&apos;s actor friends said that the duo recently discussed at length about Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput&apos;s suicide and how he was such a great person. Soon after Rajput&apos;s suicide, Sharma had penned down a write-up about the incident, requesting people to seek medical help if going through depression.

"U.S. employment growth slowed considerably in July, underscoring an urgent need for additional government aid as a resurgence of COVID19 infections threatens to snuff out the nascent economic recovery. 7, 2020, 10:15 PM IST Share this:
WASHINGTON U.S. employment growth slowed considerably in July, underscoring an urgent need for additional government aid as a resurgence of COVID-19 infections threatens to snuff out the nascent economic recovery.
The Labor Department’s closely watched employment report on Friday came as Democratic leaders in Congress and top aides to President Donald Trump struggled to negotiate a fiscal package. Trump, who lags former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic Party nominee, in polls ahead of the Nov. 3 election, threatened to bypass Congress with an executive order.
“The jobs recovery is on very shaky ground and without seat belts for the unemployed provided by additional fiscal stimulus the economy could be in for a very bumpy ride,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. “There cannot be sustainable economic growth if the country has to carry on with the crushing weight of massive unemployment.”
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 1.763 million jobs last month after a record rise of 4.791 million in June. Excluding government employment which was artificially boosted by a seasonal quirk related to local and state government education, and temporary hiring for the 2020 Census, payrolls rose 1.462 million, stepping down from 4.737 million in June.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 1.6 million jobs were added in July. While the number exceeded expectations, the economy has regained only 9.3 million of 22 million jobs lost between February and April.
Blacks continued to experience high unemployment. Racial inequality is a dominant theme in November’s election.
Economists believe July was probably the last month of employment gains related to the rehiring of workers after the reopening of businesses. A $600 weekly unemployment benefit supplement, which made up 20% of personal income, expired last Friday. Thousands of businesses have exhausted loans offered by the government to help with wages, which economists estimate saved around 1.3 million jobs at the program’s peak.
Bankruptcies are accelerating, especially in the retail sector. Coronavirus infections have soared across the country, forcing authorities in some of the worst-affected areas in the West and South to either shut down businesses again or pause reopenings, sending workers back home. The West and South account more than a third of the nation’s employment. Demand for services has been hardest hit by the respiratory illness.
“The initial bounce from widespread re-openings is now behind us,” said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. “Further improvement will occur in fits and starts and depends on the course of the virus.”
Slowing employment growth challenges the U.S. stock market’s expectation of a V-shaped recovery. The S&P 500 index is up nearly 50% from its March trough. Economists see a U or W-shaped recovery.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
BROAD SLOWDOWN
The economy, which entered recession in February, suffered its biggest blow since the Great Depression in the second quarter, with gross domestic product dropping at its steepest pace in at least 73 years.
Job growth slowed across all sectors last month. The leisure and hospitality industry hired 592,000 workers, accounting for about a third of nonfarm payrolls. The bulk of the jobs were at restaurants and bars. Retail employment rose by 258,000 jobs, with almost half of the gain in clothing and accessories stores.
Professional and business services added 170,000 jobs, concentrated in the temporary help services.
Government employment increased by 301,000. The model that the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data normally anticipates education workers to drop off payrolls in July. This, however, happened earlier because of the pandemic, leading to a big gain in July.
The unemployment rate fell to 10.2% from 11.1% in June. It was again biased downward by people misclassifying themselves as being “employed but absent from work.” Without this error, the jobless rate would have been about 11.2%. About 62,000 people dropped out the labor force last month, contributing to the drop in the reported unemployment rate.
Joblessness fell across all demographic groups, but remained high for Blacks, with the unemployment rate dipping to 14.6% from 15.4% in June. The unemployment rate for Hispanics dropped to 12.9% from 14.5%. The jobless rate for whites declined 9.2% from 10.1%.
Women, who have borne the brunt of the job losses because of child care issues, saw their unemployment rate fall to 10.5% from 11.2% mostly as they withdrew from the labor force.
“The U.S. economy was marked by intergenerational, racial, and gender inequality before the pandemic, and today’s report does nothing to alter that reality,” said Nicole Goldin,nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. Also Watch

The gap in the U.S. jobless rate between whites and Blacks widened for a third straight month in July, making the gulf between the races the widest in more than five years, Labor Department data released on Friday showed.
The rate for both races fell in July, but the rate for whites dropped more, by 0.9 percentage point to 9.2%. The rate for Blacks dropped by 0.8 percentage point to 14.6%, widening the gap to 5.4 points.
The average unemployment rate for all demographic groups fell by 0.9 percentage points to 10.2% from 11.1%.
Black vs white unemployment https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbvgbxrjpq/Pasted%20image%201596806054724.png
The COVID-19 pandemic, which has triggered the deepest U.S. recession since at least the Great Depression, has also laid bare economic inequalities between the races that have persisted for years even as a record-long economic expansion brought the unemployment rate to 50-year lows before the outbreak.
Job losses during the coronavirus downturn have fallen hardest on Blacks, Hispanics and women, wiping out much of the gains they had enjoyed in the final leg of the expansion.
Blacks were the only major demographic group whose jobless rate decline in July was smaller than the national average. The largest decline was for Asians, for whom it fell by 1.8 points to 12%, followed by a 1.6 point drop to 12.9% for Latinos.
At 14.6%, the unemployment rate for Blacks was the highest among the racial and ethnic groups tracked by the Labor Department. It was higher still for Black men at 15.2%, down from 16.3% in June, while for Black women the rate dropped to 13.5% from 14%.
The widening spread between racial group jobless rates in the last three months has reversed years of gains toward slowly bringing unemployment rates between Blacks and whites closer to parity.
Last August, the unemployment rate for Black workers dropped to a record low of 5.4% and the gap between Black and white workers narrowed to 2 points, the narrowest since the Labor Department retooled its measurement of employment by race in 1972.
Unemployment across age and race https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyvrkaoqpe/Pasted%20image%201596805780917.png
For Black teenagers, the employment situation remains particularly bleak. While their jobless rate fell to 22.5% in July from 23.2% a month earlier, it was entirely because 26,000 African Americans between the ages of 16 and 19 dropped out of the workforce. Also Watch

In fact, 15,000 fewer Black teens were working in July than in June, while the number of white teens at work rose by 149,000, and their jobless rate dropped by 5.5 percentage points to 17.8%.

"U.S. employment growth slowed considerably in July amid a resurgence in new COVID19 infections, offering the clearest evidence yet that the economy's recovery from the recession caused by the pandemic was faltering. 7, 2020, 7:21 PM IST Share this:
WASHINGTON U.S. employment growth slowed considerably in July amid a resurgence in new COVID-19 infections, offering the clearest evidence yet that the economy’s recovery from the recession caused by the pandemic was faltering.
The Labor Department’s closely watched employment report on Friday piles pressure on the White House and Congress to reach an agreement on another aid package. Talks have been dragging over differences on major issues including the size of a government benefit for tens of millions of unemployed workers.
A $600 weekly unemployment benefit supplement expired last Friday, while thousands of businesses have burned through loans offered by the government to help with wages.
“The jobs recovery is on very shaky ground and without seat belts for the unemployed provided by additional fiscal stimulus the economy could be in for a very bumpy ride,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. “There cannot be sustainable economic growth if the country has to carry on with the crushing weight of massive unemployment.”
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 1.763 million jobs last month after a record rise of 4.791 million in June. That left payrolls 12.9 million below their pre-pandemic level. Employment peaked at 152.5 million in February.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 1.6 million jobs were added in July. Many say July was probably the last month of employment gains related to the rehiring of workers after the reopening of businesses.
The slowing labor market is more bad news for President Donald Trump, who is lagging in opinion polls behind former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic Party nominee for the Nov. 3 election.
The economy, which entered into recession in February, suffered its biggest blow since the Great Depression in the second quarter, with gross domestic product dropping at its steepest pace in at least 73 years.
Infections of the respiratory illness soared across the country last month, forcing authorities in some of the worst-affected areas in the West and South to either shut down businesses again or pause reopenings, sending workers back home. Demand for goods and services has suffered.
Last month’s slowdown in job growth occurred across all sectors, with the exception of government. The leisure and hospitality industry hired 592,000 workers, accounting for about a third of nonfarm payrolls. The bulk of the jobs were at restaurants and bars. Retail employment rose by 258,000 jobs, with almost half of the gain in clothing and accessories stores.
Professional and business services added 170,000 jobs, concentrated in the temporary help services. Government employment increased by 301,000 in July, artificially boosted by hefty gains in state and local government education.
The model that the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data normally anticipates education workers to drop off payrolls in July. This, however, happened earlier because of the pandemic, leading to a big gain in July.
U.S. stocks opened lower while the dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were trading largely higher.
MILLIONS UNEMPLOYED
The unemployment rate fell to 10.2% from 11.1% in June, but it has been biased downward by people misclassifying themselves as being “employed but absent from work.”
The Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the report, estimated that the jobless rate would have been 11.2% without this error. The BLS, however, cautioned that the 1 percentage point estimate “represents the upper bound of our estimate of misclassification and probably overstates the size of the misclassification error.”
At least 31.3 million people were receiving unemployment checks in mid-July. The slowdown in hiring challenges the U.S. stock market’s expectation of a V-shaped recovery. The S&P 500 index is up nearly 50% from its March trough. As COVID-19 cases spiral, and Republicans and Democrats bicker over another stimulus package, economists see a W-shaped recovery. Also Watch

Economists estimate the Paycheck Protection Program that gave businesses loans that can be partially forgiven if used for employee pay saved around 1.3 million jobs at its peak. The extra $600 weekly unemployment checks made up 20% of personal income and helped to boost consumer spending in May and June.

"Manish Chokhani, Director of Enam Holdings, in a recent interview said he fears the ‘Japanification of the world where there is no real growth’. Once not too long ago most countries wished to be like Japan as the country quickly turned around its economic fortunes with technology and development. So much so that Japanification was a matter of pride for most countries. Not anymore. Japanification has come to mean a country which has been suffering from all kinds of stagnation: political, demographic and economic. How did this unwanted transition happen, and that too so quickly? Japan was totally devastated during World War II and no one imagined that Japan would be the talking point of world economy in next few decades. In quick time, Japanese companies and their products captured the imagination of one and all. Whether it was automobiles where we had names such as Toyota, Honda, Suzuki etc. or household goods where names were Sony, Casio etc….and who can forget the Bullet trains? ‘Made in Japan’ became a top brand by itself and a sign of top quality. There has been fair bit of research trying to understand the Japanese growth and the factors are as diverse as it can get: Industrial policy, undervalued exchange rate, exposure to foreign competition, role of government, importance of technology and so on. Japan’s per capita GDP in 1960 was around $8,600, one-third of the United States per capita GDP. By 1988, Japanese per capital GDP had touched $ 35,000 levels surpassing the US. In the period, average per capita growth in Japan was 5.2 percent, double that of the US. Apart from GDP, all other indicators of development surged, and Japan became a developed country which so far was a club of European economies and the US. The Japanese economic model became an inspiration for other Asian economies and economies such as South Korea and China also used variants of the Japanese models. The Japanese fairy tale ended in 1989 starting with a stock market crash followed by crisis in banks and non-banks, and collapse of the overall economy. In 1998, the US economy overtook Japan in terms of per capita income and continued to widen the gap. The US per capita income in 2018 was $55,000 compared to the $49,000 of Japan. Japan’s average per capita GDP growth rate in period 1998-2018 has been 0.76 percent, half of the US average in the same period. How times turned around! Just like the Japanese surge surprised all, the stagnation has been equally vexing. Macroeconomists pointed out how Japanese policymakers did not address the declining economy with alacrity and delayed fiscal and monetary stimulus. More importantly, they delayed responses towards the financial sector and research shows that a financial crisis delays and prolongs an economic crisis. This was one of the central lesson from the Great Depression as well where large-scale banking failures in the US made the depression a prolonged affair. Japanese demographics too turned adverse as the country has been increasingly having a higher share of aged people compared to younger ones. Since then, Japanese policymakers have struggled to put the economy back on track. There have been several attempts but the economy remains mired in deflation and low-growth conditions. The term lost decade became synonymous with Japan, and by 2019 we had three such lost decades. The term began to be used for other economies which let go of opportunities, and had lower-than-expected growth. For instance, Puja Mehra recently wrote a book on Indian economy titled The Lost Decade (2008-18). As the 2008 crisis struck, one problem facing developed countries was to avoid another Great Depression. They managed to avoid the Great Depression but it soon struck that they could resemble Japan. In 2013, American economist Lawrence Summers spoke on how the developed world could be stuck in secular stagnation with low growth rates and little hope for revival of growth rates. Summers obviously mentioned Japan in the speech for its lower growth rates. Summers added the policymakers should take advantage of the low interest rates and push for investment to get out of the stagnation. In a February interview, European Central Bank (ECB) chief economist Philip Lane was asked a question on whether there will be Japanification of the Eurozone economy? He said that recent ECB policies such as resuming quantitative easing and negative interest rates are an attempt to ensure there is no Japanification of Eurozone economies. These policies are an attempt to bring inflation to positive zone, unlike Japan which has struggled with low deflation for a long time now. As economists and policymakers think and act on preventing the Japanification of their economies, one cannot help but think how quickly Japanification has become a word of good riddance for economics rather than good acceptance as was the case earlier. How did Japan’s story become like that of a business organisation which rises to stirring heights only to decline and remain stagnant thereafter? American and European economists have for long lectured Japanese on getting rid of their long crisis. Japanese policymakers have grappled with their suggestions and even tried their own. Their response is that that best way to avoid a Japanese style economic crisis is to make sure the crisis does not happen at the first place. Americans and Europeans (and even Asians) are now learning the taste of Japanese medicine. All is not lost for Japan though, and they have plenty to offer the world. Their sanitation and mask-wearing habits are lessons for countries. In a recent research, Hirotaka Takeuchi of Harvard Business School pointed how Japanese companies are so good at surviving crises. They plan for 100-200 years knowing there will be crises and we need to fight the same. This approach is needed by the businesses across the world which are grappling with the current pandemic.

"In a webinar hosted by Brown University, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top US Infectious diseases expert said that the likely chance the COVID-19 vaccine could end up being effective is only 50-60 per cent Reuters 10:17 IST
An approved coronavirus vaccine could end up being effective only 50-60% of the time, meaning public health measures will still be needed to keep the pandemic under control, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious diseases expert, said on Friday.
""We don't know yet what the efficacy might be. We don't know if it will be 50% or 60%. I'd like it to be 75% or more,"" Fauci said in a webinar hosted by Brown University. ""But the chances of it being 98% effective is not great, which means you must never abandon the public health approach.""
The novel coronavirus has infected nearly 5 million people in the United States and killed more than 160,000. Lockdown measures imposed to keep the virus from spreading have devastated the economy, which suffered its biggest blow since the Great Depression in the second quarter, with gross domestic product dropping at its steepest pace in at least 73 years.
As infections have spiked around the country after states started to open up, public health experts, including Fauci, have stressed the importance of steps that each American can take, including social distancing, washing hands and wearing masks.
Fauci said on Friday that studies of Moderna Inc's COVID-19 vaccine could produce definitive data in November or December of this year. He told Reuters earlier this week that he expects tens of millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses to be available by early 2021, and a billion doses by the end of that year.
U.S. President Donald Trump has put forward a more optimistic forecast, saying on Thursday the country could have a coronavirus vaccine before the Nov. 3 election."

"National security in challenging times Blogs July 25, 2020, 3:48 pm IST Economic Times in ET Commentary | India | ET
By Dr. Manjari Singh
National security has been the buzzword in International Relations since the times of the formation of nation-states. Territorial security in pre-colonial and colonial times got merely translated into national security when nation-states were carved out of the protectorates and colonies. The concept drew majorly from Hans Morgenthau’s understanding of securing national interest by the preservation of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and internal stability from external forces. It did not change much until the 1980s when the non-traditional security aspect was felt to be equally affecting national security if not directly.
Today, while the global security is under threat as the world faces an unprecedented challenge in the form of a “faceless enemy”, the COVID-19 pandemic; nevertheless, securing national interests remains paramount even in this situation. As the pandemic affects all dimensions either directly or in indirect sense, therefore ‘national outlook for national security approach’ is important for an overall inclusive development of nations. While the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has called the crisis the “Great Lockdown” and has predicted a slump in economy worse than the Great Depression; social implications of the pandemic will also be huge. India itself witnessed huge mass displacement during the time of lockdowns. Advancement in technology has enabled state and non-state actors to upgrade their military capabilities and the ability to disrupt huge systems by attacking strategic assets respectively. To top it all, while the genesis of COVID-19 remains unclear, sceptics fear the misuse of such viruses by non-state actors to cause maximum disruption and to create threat perception. And thus, it is like an open wound that requires permanent healing!
In that regard, it is necessary to analyse India’s preparedness in multi-dimensional spheres. Spread of new virus has made it clear that non-traditional threats to security are activated, however, traditional threats to national security still remain valid. India’s northern adversary’s rise and influence on India’s neighbourhood through its ambitious projects and investments, its recent belligerence on the border, and India’s western adversary’s constant pestering with activation of non-state actors in Kashmir, signal that heightened security apparatus at the borders cannot be downplayed.
With the above background of national security in mind, Centre for Land Warfare Studies (CLAWS), an Indian Army affiliated Think Tank in New Delhi, has initiated to publish two timely books: one, dealing with India’s future preparedness with regard to COVID-19 and another on national security challenges.
COVID-19 & Its Challenges: Is India Future Ready? is not only an unprecedented attempt on the subject but is also on similar lines with National Security Advisor’s orders in March which highlighted three post-COVID national security scenarios, namely, economic impact and need for social harmony; study on India’s two adversaries keeping in mind various wargaming scenarios and lastly to prepare a comprehensive road map for future readiness. The book with its holistic approach deals with various aspects of national security in terms of need to prioritise on human and environmental security in national security; self-reliance and self-sufficiency in various dimensions to achieve maximum sustainability; evolving role of Indian Armed Forces that will lead to re-appraisal of India’s military thinking; and use of advanced technology for a better security apparatus. At the end, the book provides an all-encompassing list of palatable policy recommendations.
A national outlook calls for involvement of all sections of society in nation building. Given the youthful demographic status of the country, it becomes necessary to make the younger generations aware of the growing national security challenges and threats that India faces. With that vision in mind, CLAWS initiated an unprecedented venture in the form of a pan-India university level essay competition in 2018 and named it after the Grand Indian Strategist, Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw whose passion, valour and foresightedness during the Indo-Pakistan war of 1971 was a success not only for India but also led to liberation of Bangladesh.
The book, National Security Challenges: Young Scholars’ Perspective, is the outcome of Field Marshal Essay Competition (FMMEC) held during 2018-19 and carries 12 selected papers from students of various universities all across the country. The book is thematised into conceptual framework of national security and its various aspects; threats and challenges emanating from technological advancement and experiences from national, regional and global scenarios. Notably, despite the importance of the subject, universities in the country are in the infant stage of introducing national security studies as a separate course in their curriculum; in that regard, this publication by CLAWS provides a suitable platform for the students to voice their opinion on the subject. Varied subjects covered in the book shows that the youth are well aware and updated on the challenges facing the country. Policy recommendations at the end of each chapter provides sneak peek into what the young scholars of this country think about national security.

"Zoom CEO and co-founder, Eric Yuan on Friday said India is the second largest market for the company after the US and that it was looking to increase its global presence in the future.
In a candid chat with Rajan Anandan , President, TiE Delhi-NCR and MD, Sequoia Capital during the India Internet Day 2020 in association with Floor by 10Times, Yuan added that the new office in Bangalore will help get more feedback from Indian local users and build a friendlier platform for them.
“India is our second biggest market and I want to thank all of our users in the country. The US is the biggest market for Zoom, followed by India and then Japan,” he said.
He also mentioned that many of Zoom’s employees are of Indian origin including its COO Aparna Bawa, President of Product and Engineering Velchamy Sankarlingam and Corporate Chief Information Officer Sunil Madan. Subhra Iyar, co-founder of WebEx has been his advisor and investor in Zoom.
Yuan said that his favorite usage of Zoom in India is telemedicine and the access to a doctor from any part of the country is very impressive.
“Doctors from one city can serve any number of patients in a timely manner. Another best usage is online class and online teaching from central universities, schools and colleges, people are using zoom to continue studies. Apart from this, there are lots of yoga and fitness classes through Zoom in India and they are super interesting. I would add is the wedding celebrations in India over Zoom which is becoming so popular. So from young kids to grandparents, everyone is using Zoom in India and that is very exciting,” he said.
He also mentioned that in the US, now marriages conducted over Zoom are legal and the feature is known as Zoom marriage.
When asked about what the future of video communications look like when the world will come out of Covid-19, Yuan said even after the coronavirus outbreak will be gone, work from home will become a preferred working style for many.
“I think many businesses will allow their employees to work from home. The main challenge here is how to make sure Zoom will give a better and safer experience to users than compared to that in an office environment. Today, people are also suffering through anxiety, depression from too many meetings, so how to make you sure to mitigate those problems giving a virtual face-to-face experience. We believe, at Zoom, we should be able to deliver a better service. However, we are not there yet,” he said.
Yuan said that in the future, sometime in 2040, technologies like Artificial Intelligence, can have some real problems in translation. “However, through video communications, I want the other person to feel the intimacy, to shake hands and feel the presence and these features will be there in the future. In one click, the coffee you have with you, I can smell it from here. I truly believe that’s how we are going to live in the future,” he said.
He added that when that happens, people can work from anywhere and people will feel like they are in the same conference room.
Talking about the future of Zoom Communications, Yuan said that they want to become more and more global. “Prior to the financial crisis caused by the coronavirus, most of the revenue came from North America- US and Canada, a little bit of Europe. More international expansion is another opportunity we are working on. Apart from this, we want to introduce more services. Two years ago we introduced a cloud-based PBX system, now we are going to introduce more services either for enterprise customers or some new use cases,” he said."

"MUMBAI, Aug. 5 -- India's top anti-crime agency is taking over the investigation into the death of movie star Sushant Singh Rajput, whose suicide has shaken Bollywood and sparked bitter recriminations.
Rajput, 34, was found dead in June in his Mumbai apartment - with police saying he took his own life - setting off a debate over mental health in the multi-billion-dollar industry.
His former girlfriend, fellow actor Rhea Chakraborty, petitioned the Supreme Court today after Rajput's family disputed reports that he suffered from depression and accused her of stealing his money and harassing him.
Chakraborty strongly denied the allegations and asked the country's highest court to transfer the case from local police in Rajput's home state ... "
"Economists believe July was probably the last month of employment gains related to the rehiring of workers after the reopening of businesses Reuters 13 IST
U.S. employment growth slowed considerably in July, underscoring an urgent need for additional government aid as a resurgence of COVID-19 infections threatens to snuff out the nascent economic recovery.
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday came as Democratic leaders in Congress and top aides to President Donald Trump struggled to negotiate a fiscal package. Trump, who lags former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic Party nominee, in polls ahead of the Nov. 3 election, threatened to bypass Congress with an executive order.
""The jobs recovery is on very shaky ground and without seat belts for the unemployed provided by additional fiscal stimulus the economy could be in for a very bumpy ride,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""There cannot be sustainable economic growth if the country has to carry on with the crushing weight of massive unemployment.""
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 1.763 million jobs last month after a record rise of 4.791 million in June. Excluding government employment which was artificially boosted by a seasonal quirk related to local and state government education, and temporary hiring for the 2020 Census, payrolls rose 1.462 million, stepping down from 4.737 million in June.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 1.6 million jobs were added in July. While the number exceeded expectations, the economy has regained only 9.3 million of 22 million jobs lost between February and April. Blacks continued to experience high unemployment. Racial inequality is a dominant theme in November's election.
Economists believe July was probably the last month of employment gains related to the rehiring of workers after the reopening of businesses. A $600 weekly unemployment benefit supplement, which made up 20% of personal income, expired last Friday. Thousands of businesses have exhausted loans offered by the government to help with wages, which economists estimate saved around 1.3 million jobs at the program's peak.
Bankruptcies are accelerating, especially in the retail sector. Coronavirus infections have soared across the country, forcing authorities in some of the worst-affected areas in the West and South to either shut down businesses again or pause reopenings, sending workers back home. The West and South account more than a third of the nation's employment. Demand for services has been hardest hit by the respiratory illness.
""The initial bounce from widespread re-openings is now behind us,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Further improvement will occur in fits and starts and depends on the course of the virus."" Slowing employment growth challenges the U.S. stock market's expectation of a V-shaped recovery. The S&P 500 index is up nearly 50% from its March trough. Economists see a U or W-shaped recovery.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
BROAD SLOWDOWN
The economy, which entered recession in February, suffered its biggest blow since the Great Depression in the second quarter, with gross domestic product dropping at its steepest pace in at least 73 years.
Job growth slowed across all sectors last month. The leisure and hospitality industry hired 592,000 workers, accounting for about a third of nonfarm payrolls. The bulk of the jobs were at restaurants and bars. Retail employment rose by 258,000 jobs, with almost half of the gain in clothing and accessories stores.
Professional and business services added 170,000 jobs, concentrated in the temporary help services. Government employment increased by 301,000. The model that the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data normally anticipates education workers to drop off payrolls in July. This, however, happened earlier because of the pandemic, leading to a big gain in July.
The unemployment rate fell to 10.2% from 11.1% in June. It was again biased downward by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" Without this error, the jobless rate would have been about 11.2%. About 62,000 people dropped out the labor force last month, contributing to the drop in the reported unemployment rate.
Joblessness fell across all demographic groups, but remained high for Blacks, with the unemployment rate dipping to 14.6% from 15.4% in June. The unemployment rate for Hispanics dropped to 12.9% from 14.5%. The jobless rate for whites declined 9.2% from 10.1%.
Women, who have borne the brunt of the job losses because of child care issues, saw their unemployment rate fall to 10.5% from 11.2% mostly as they withdrew from the labor force. ""The U.S. economy was marked by intergenerational, racial, and gender inequality before the pandemic, and today's report does nothing to alter that reality,"" said Nicole Goldin,nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.
There were more part-time workers. The number of people on temporary layoff fell, but permanent job losers were little changed at 2.9 million. Average hourly earnings increased 0.2% in July after a drop of 1.3% in June. The workweek shortened to an average of 34.5 hours from 34.6 hours."
"Home / Technology & Science / Trump Signs Executive Orders Barring Transactions With TikTok and WeChat in 45 Days Trump Signs Executive Orders Barring Transactions With TikTok and WeChat in 45 Days
P resident Donald Trump signed a pair of executive orders prohibiting U.S. residents from doing any business with TikTok, WeChat or the apps’ Chinese owners beginning 45 days from now, citing the national security risk of leaving Americans’ personal data exposed.
The move coincides with Trump’s push for the sale of TikTok, the popular video app owned by ByteDance Ltd., to an American company, and it comes a day after Secretary of State Michael Pompeo urged U.S. businesses to remove Chinese apps from their stores. The measure threatens penalties on any U.S. resident or company that engages in any transactions with TikTok, WeChat or their owners after the order takes effect.
“This mobile application may also be used for disinformation campaigns that benefit the Chinese Communist Party,” Trump said in the order, released Thursday by the White House. The data collection through TikTok “threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans’ personal and proprietary information — potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.”
TikTok and WeChat representatives didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
WeChat is the messaging software developed by China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd. that has evolved into an all-purpose app that allows people to use it for payments, e-commerce and more. The app is one of the most popular in the world with more than 1 billion users.
Tencent is one of China’s largest tech companies. Its Chief Executive Officer Pony Ma is among the many business leaders who serves as a delegate to the National People’s Congress, China’s rubber-stamp parliament.
Tencent shares fell as much as 1.5% in morning trading. The offshore yuan weakened as much as 0.27%, the most since July 22, to 6.9624 a dollar.
Banning Wechat in the U.S. could have far greater implications to cross-border business between Chinese and American companies, impacting everything from the manufacturing of medical face masks and Apple iPhones to the inking contracts of lawyers and bankers.
While WeChat is not popular in the U.S. as a consumer messaging tool, the messaging app isn’t just used to chat with friends and family. In China, it’s virtually impossible to function without Wechat and is essentially used by businesses in the place of email and text messages, which are not used as widely in China as they are in the U.S. Other messaging apps like Facebook Inc.-owned Whatsapp are blocked in China, making it harder to communicate with overseas partners without WeChat.

"Researcher Rita Giacaman works to understand the impact that conflict and continued exposure to violence have on the health of the Palestinian population .
Since the beginning of the 20th century, the history of Palestine has been marked by conflict and violence. The uninterrupted Israeli occupation of the West Bank, the blockade of Gaza and the systematic denial of rights to the local population have generated a chronic and complex crisis that has seriously affected the health of the Palestinians, leaving multiple wounds in the form of psychological and emotional problems.
In this context, different investigations have addressed the impact that the political and social conditions to which the Palestinians are subjected have on their psychological well-being. One of them – The Burden of Mental Disorders in the Eastern Mediterranean Region 1990-2013 – highlights that there has been an increase in mental health disorders in Palestine and that more than 40% of the population suffers from clinical anxiety and depression, which makes it the highest rate in the world.
For researcher Rita Giacaman, the reasons for this extraordinary figure are not based on reality, but on the way in which these types of disorders are categorised: through the DSM, a classification system developed in the United States with the aim of treating the different mental disorders. According to Giacaman, the measures contained in this diagnostic code, in addition to being “alien to Arab culture and the Palestinian context, are intended for clinics and patients, and not for the general population.”
In the opinion of the expert, who is also the founder of the Institute of Public and Community Health at Birzeit University in Ramallah (West Bank), there is the main problem in the classification of mental disorders, since most of the scientific literature defends a biomedical model. “It stigmatises us as mentally ill when, in reality, our problems are social and political.”
Both Giacaman and different researchers from the Arab world question the western biomedical framework and have developed an alternative approach that links mental health with environmental circumstances and with indicators of social well-being.
“Most of the Palestinians live in a situation of chronic warlike conditions and violence, so many feel anguish or stress, fluctuating between well-being and illness. Depending on the resources we have, we can reduce our suffering or we will end up suffering psychological consequences for the rest of our lives, ”explains Giacaman.
In the eyes of the researcher, the problem cannot be tackled solely with pills and individual therapy: “Although some mental health disorders need therapeutic support of this type, the best therapy for Palestinians are support groups with which to share experiences. traumatic events and go to the bottom of what happens to them ”.
Health and justice
After the partition of Palestine by the UN in 1947 and the massive expulsion of its Arab inhabitants by the Israeli armed forces, Palestinians were presented in the scientific literature as victims, terrorists or refugees, but, in any case, without any recognition. that the circumstances they suffered affected their mental health.
However, with the outbreak of the First Intifada in 1987 and the interest of the media, it began to be documented that the Palestinians were really traumatised, that they had injuries and not only on their bodies. This research development led to counterproductive results.
On the one hand, the idea that Palestinians could be traumatised by oppression and political violence was consolidated. On the other, the emphasis on the discourse of “trauma” led to the adoption of programs exclusively focused on depression and post-traumatic stress disorder as a central treatment model in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
Faced with the narrow biomedical paradigm, the Birzeit Institute of Public and Community Health (IPHC) links justice and health, concentrating on the latter being a force for change in the living conditions of Palestinians.
“Living through the Israeli military occupation of our land every day we begin to realise that health is a social construction and that the psychological damage suffered by Palestinians is caused by an unjust social and political reality. In this way, we began to see that we needed to develop research that could help transform the living conditions of our people ”, says Giacaman.
One such investigation was the study Mental Suffering in a Protracted Political Conflict: Feeling Broken or Destroyed , in which Giacaman and other researchers interviewed 68 politically active Palestinians during the First Intifada.
During the meetings, the participants described a more existential form of suffering that, according to them, was the result of the political and economic context in which they live: feeling that one’s spirit, morals and / or future are broken or destroyed.
“Many people who have been very active in politics and now see what is happening in Palestine say they feel ‘destroyed’ or ‘broken’. Those of us who do not feel that way, are either crazy – jokes the researcher – or we maintain hope by training young people and creating institutions that may be useful in the future ”.
The triple captivity of women
Since its creation in the late 1970s, the IPHC has played an important role in the development of various projects aimed at meeting the needs of Palestinian women and improving their health.
“We were the first to develop comprehensive projects focused on the well-being of women of all ages and not just those of reproductive age,” says Giacaman.
In a 2013 study titled Our Life is Prison: The Triple Captivity of Wives and Mothers of Palestinian Political Prisoners , Giacaman and American scholar Penny Johnson analysed the impact of the incarceration of Palestinian men on their wives and children. “Until that moment, all the studies dealt with the prisoners, but they did not talk about their families and, even less, about their wives,” she says.
During interviews with the wives and mothers of Palestinian political prisoners, the researchers found descriptions of triple captivity: “Within the Israeli colonial system, they are held captive because they cannot see their husband and because they must mediate between prison and family life. On the other hand, they are also conditioned by their community, given that the machismo that prevails in Palestinian society implies that many of these women have to stay isolated in their homes for fear of ‘what will they say’ and to maintain their reputation ”, argues the expert.
Resilience in the face of adversity
The stalemate in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is growing, and as a result, the political, social and economic situation in the Occupied Territories worsens year after year. However, despite the high levels of suffering experienced by the population, defeatism is not something that is heard among the Palestinians.
Giacaman attributes part of that attitude to the strong social and family cohesion that exists in Palestine: “We are very connected to the community and we receive a lot of support, which helps us to move forward. Furthermore, when there are problems we are not alone or isolated: we resist together because we are all going through the same thing, ”he declares.
For Palestinians hope, often combined with the ability to endure and resist, is a form of political and personal struggle that enables them to survive with dignity and decency under occupation. “We continue to resist in the face of adversity because we have no choice and because we understand that the moral imperative is ours: we know that we are busy and that the Israelis are the occupiers,” she says with conviction."

"Young women with PCOS at higher risk of heart disease Young women with PCOS at higher risk of heart disease Photo Credit :
Sophia Antipolis [France], August 8 (ANI): A new study suggests that women in their 30s and 40s with a common condition affecting how the ovaries work are more likely to get heart disease.The study has been published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, a journal of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).""Polycystic ovary syndrome isn't a life sentence - there are many ways to stay heart healthy. Small changes add up, like eating more fruits and vegetables and doing more exercise,"" said study author Dr. Clare Oliver-Williams of the University of Cambridge, UK.It is estimated that 6-20 percent of women of reproductive age have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Features of the condition include multiple cysts (fluid-filled sacs) on the ovaries, irregular periods, excess body hair or hair loss from the head due to high levels of male hormones, and difficulty becoming pregnant.Women with PCOS are more likely to be overweight or obese, have diabetes, and have high blood pressure - all risk factors for heart disease and stroke.This study examined whether this risky profile translates into a greater likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease - and, for the first time, whether that persists across the lifespan.""Some PCOS symptoms are only present during the reproductive years, so it's possible that the raised chance of heart disease might disappear later in life,"" said Dr. Oliver-Williams.The study included 60,574 women receiving treatment to help them get pregnant, such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), from 1994 to 2015. Of those, 6,149 (10.2 percent had PCOS. The researchers used medical records to follow women for nine years. During that period, 2,925 (4.8 percent) women developed cardiovascular disease.Overall, women with PCOS were at 19 percent higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease than women who did not have PCOS.When divided into age groups, women with PCOS aged 50 and over did not have a higher risk of developing cardiovascular risk compared to their peers without PCOS.Women in their 30s and 40s with PCOS were at greater risk of cardiovascular disease compared to those without PCOS. The evidence in those under 30 was less clear; this is likely because there were insufficient women of that age in the dataset to identify the risk.""Heart health appears to be a particular problem for young women with PCOS. This may be because they are more likely to be overweight and have high blood pressure and diabetes compared to their peers,"" said Dr. Oliver-Williams.""Previous studies have suggested that these differences diminish with age. In other words, as women without PCOS get older, they increasingly become overweight and develop high blood pressure and diabetes. In a negative sense, they catch up to their peers with PCOS,"" added Williams.""PCOS can be a distressing condition. Not just because it can affect fertility. The physical effects can cause anxiety and depression. There's so much pressure on young women to achieve what we're told is the physical ideal. It takes age and time to embrace yourself and getting support from others is a vital step, so reach out if you need it,"" she added.""Knowledge is power and being aware of the heart risks means women with PCOS can do something about it. Women with PCOS have been dealt a tough hand but this is about how these women play their cards. There are fantastic PCOS support groups where they can find out what has helped others with PCOS lose weight, get more exercise, and have a healthier diet,"" said Dr. Oliver-Williams.She noted that the study only included Scandinavian women taking fertility treatment and caution is needed when extending the findings to other groups.

In recent days, tenant activists have stormed courthouses in Kansas City and New Orleans. They’ve crowded, chanting, into real estate law firms in New York City . They’ve protested outside a mayor’s home in Los Angeles and marched with signs through another mayor’s neighborhood in Milwaukee.
Their message to landlords and government leaders: Don’t allow evictions to occur during a global pandemic. Tenant activists are worried about the millions of unemployed Americans who now stand on the edge of an unprecedented housing crisis that could leave as many as 40 million people facing eviction by the end of the year.
“We are standing up to put a stop to this,” Iris Butler told the Denver Post Thursday, when about two dozen protesters demonstrated in front of the Webb Municipal Building to demand the restoration of Colorado’s eviction moratorium, which expired in June.
Cops in SWAT gear later told the anti-eviction protesters to disperse or face arrest, according to the Denver Post, so the group moved closer to the street.
Nearly 1,700 miles away, about 50 anti-eviction protesters also gathered outside a courthouse in Ithaca, New York on Thursday. They brought couches and shopping carts into the driveway of the Ithaca Police Department and court building to replicate the scene of an evicted home, according to the Ithaca Voice .
“During the pandemic when all of us got laid off from our jobs and we can’t fight for higher wages anymore, we had to turn to fighting to stay in homes,” Genevieve Rand, an organizer for the Ithaca Tenants Union said during the protest, according to the Ithaca Voice. “The pandemic has exposed down to the cracks, all the breakage in our society that let people like us fall through the cracks.”
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo extended the state’s eviction moratorium until Sept. 4 this week, just before it was scheduled to expire.
The demonstrations are an extension of the organizing that led to rent strikes and the formation of tenant unions across the country earlier this year , when activists warned that the country would face widespread homelessness without significant government action.
While states and municipalities enacted eviction moratoriums in response to their pleas, many of those protections have expired or weakened in recent weeks, as the pandemic has grown worse. A moratorium on evicting tenants from federally backed properties expired last month, right around the time an extra $600 weekly benefit for unemployed workers lapsed. And Congress has yet to come to an agreement on another relief package .
With its increasing urgency, the tenant movement now echoes the wave of demonstrations that occurred in the 1930s during the Great Depression, when some New York City activists not only withheld rent but fought the police and landlords who tried to evict them .
So-called “eviction blockades,” in which activists personally protect tenants from removal, have also resurfaced with force during the pandemic.
Activists gathered outside a Brooklyn apartment last month to confront a landlord who had allegedly tried to force out his tenants, according to Gothamist.
In Los Angeles, activists blocked a moving van from removing a tenant’s belongings after their landlord had changed the locks on their apartment, according to the Real Deal , a media company covering real estate. A contractor armed with a power drill got the door open so the tenant could move back in.
And the protests aren’t just happening at homes but on the doorsteps of city and court officials. Perhaps most remarkably, anti-eviction protesters gathered outside a New Orleans courthouse in such great numbers last week that they effectively walled off entrances, leading cases to be rescheduled.
That same day, Kansas City tenant organizers rallied outside a courthouse, while some protesters took turns entering courtrooms. In doing so, one activist, Jenay Manley, was arrested after she chanted “All evictions are violent” before a judge, disrupting proceedings, according to NBC News.

The year 2020 is turning to be devastating at some other level. After the tragic death of Sushant Singh Rajput, we got the news of Sameer Sharma ending his life due to depression. The actor was found dead in the kitchen of his Malad apartment. The body was seen by the watchman who informed the authorities. This has come as a huge shock for everyone. Actor Samir Soni who was a good friend of Sameer Sharma has revealed some details. It seems he was going through some crisis in his personal life. Samir Soni said, ""In June, he had borrowed my car to go to Pune. Unfortunately, he met with an accident on the way but did not inform me. A few days later, the police informed me that they had found my car by the side of the road. However, when I asked Samir about it, he denied meeting with an accident. I didn’t prod him further. Almost a month passed and I started feeling that all was not well with him.""

Samir Soni further said, ""So, last week, I visited him at his Malad residence. That’s when he apologised for the accident, and I told him that it was okay. Since he was not feeling well that day, I left within a few minutes. And then, a few days later, I hear that he has hanged himself in his flat! I kept crying all day after I heard the news. I still can’t believe that he has gone from our lives. I just wish he had reached out to someone if he was going through personal issues.""

"Sushant Singh Rajput Death: Ankita Lokhande has shared a picture of the late actor's mother on her social media saying she believed Sushant was with his mom By Urmimala Banerjee 11:24 AM IST
Ankita Lokhande and Sushant Singh Rajput's love story was a deeply cherished one by fans. The two met on the sets of Pavitra Rishta in 2011 and their friendship soon blossomed into love. They called it quits in 2016 after living-in for almost six years. The demise of the actor on June 14, 2020 left the actress shattered. However, she has broken her silence of late. Ankita Lokhande has come on news channels and slammed the depression theory. She has said that he was a sensitive person but said Sushant Singh Rajput could never be a depressed man. She said she would like people to remember him as a hero, a guy who came up from nowhere to carve his own place in the sun. Yesterday, she shared a picture of the late actor's mother with an emotional message, 'Believe You Are Together.'

Ankita Lokhande has supported the fight for justice. As we know, fans demanded a CBI Enquiry for more than two months on social media. Now, the Supreme Court has allowed a CBI Enquiry and a team has been put in place. This gained momentum after the actor's father filed a case in Patna accusing Rhea Chakraborty and her family of abetment of suicide. Rhea Chakraborty was questioned by the Enforcement Directorate for eight hours yesterday in Mumbai. Her family and business manager, Shruti Modi were also called.

"By Divyansh Thakur More than 600 home isolated patients of coronavirus in Indore, which is one of the worst hit by COVID-19 in State, have recovered and have returned to their everyday life. To keep an eye on asymptomatic patients, the city civic body had improvised its already existing mobile app ‘Indore 311’ and added some new features to it to facilitate treatment of patients at their homes. Presently, 400 coronavirus patients are home isolated and are being monitored by doctors through video calls. According to chief co-ordinator of home isolation team, Dr Hemant Jain, more than a thousand asymptomatic coronavirus patients were home isolated in Indore and nearly 600 have defeated the virus. So far, only 27 patients, who were home isolated, needed hospital treatment, Dr Jain added. He added that the patient receives adequate treatment at home and the patient’s recovery rate increases in homely environment.

"The Khans lose their charm and place to Akshay Kumar; outsiders rule among actresses. 18 IST Yasir Iqbal
Over four months after Covid-19 led to the closure of cinemas, the future of theatre owners is as dark as the properties they run. As per the india today Mood of the Nation poll, more than half the respondents, 53 per cent, said they wouldn’t visit theatres even after they reopen. That OTT platforms have fulfilled the needs of film enthusiasts has only added to the woes of theatre owners. Not to mention the many new titles premiering on OTT platforms in the past few months. The year 2020 has been a washout at the box office with only Ajay Devgn-starrer Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior earning Rs 269 crore. So, when will we see a Rs 100 crore film next?
One actor who can be trusted to deliver is Akshay Kumar, who topped the MOTN poll for the first time after tying with Salman Khan for the top spot in the last edition in January. Kumar’s strong showing in six months can be attributed to the fact that his name is untainted from the unfolding Sushant Singh Rajput saga, and that he continues to be the busiest actor of the lot. He’ll be the first star to return to work, shooting for a film in the UK from August. As makers of Kumar’s film Sooryavanshi wait for theatres to reopen, he will have a digital release, Laxmmi Bomb, in the coming months. Not too far behind Kumar was the septuagenarian Amitabh Bachchan who, despite working from home, contracted Covid.
The most notable feature of the poll, though, was how the popularity of the Khans has plummeted. For a change, it was Shah Rukh who was ahead of Salman and Aamir, with the respondents recognising the many charitable endeavours of his Meer Foundation during the lockdown. Aamir has not had a release since Thugs of Hindostan in October 2018 and SRK since Zero in December 2018. Salman’s latest instalment of Dabangg, too, failed to win over his fans. Devgn, Hrithik Roshan, who featured in 2019’s biggest hit War, and 35-year-old Ranveer Singh, the youngest actor in the crop of top 10, tied for the sixth spot.
Among the actresses, Deepika Padukone was in pole position after she made headlines for showing solidarity with students of Jawaharlal Nehru University during the promotional rounds of her maiden production Chhapaak in which she played an acid attack survivor. She is also the only one from the industry to have spoken about mental health awareness after news of Rajput’s battle with depression broke. Anushka Sharma, who is in news more for producing (Paatal Lok, Bulbbul) and her social media activity, dropped to No. 5, with Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Katrina Kaif and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan faring better.
Kangana Ranaut, meanwhile, had her best sho­wing so far given her committed act in providing video commentary from Manali on a series of issues with the prime focus being adding fuel to the fiery Rajput tragedy. Tied with Alia Bhatt, Ranaut perhaps will take solace in the fact that, like her, the top five heroines in the MOTN poll are all outsiders. "
"Hashimotos/Auto-immune/Thyroid? Hi I’m new to homeopathy. I've been struggling for a year, and don't have any real quality of life. Specialists can’t figure it out. But I think I have very early stages of Hashimotos. Any feedback is appreciated, has anyone seen anything like this in their homeopathic experiences??
Ani, 28F, 5.1”, 180lb, USA, desk-job/typing
Timeline
I had the stomach flu , and influenza , back to back, last year. Afterwards I began restricting calories/dieting to lose weight and I worked out more than I was eating. That was Jan 2019-May2019. These symptoms came in June 2019. First it was just fatigue , then digestive in Oct 2019, then joints in 2020.
Physical symptoms
Suffering from extreme fatigue (worse with mental or physical exertion), weight gain (50 lbs in the last year, eating healthy vegetarian diet), joint pain (wrist, ankles, hips), joint burning sensation (knuckles, fingertips), digestive issues when eating food, no pattern with the food, some days the same food is fine, other days it causes issues, night or day doesn't make a difference (nausea, acid reflux type, burping eases it, bloating, constipation, but still is somewhat loose when I finally go), ear problems ( tinnitus ), mucous in throat constant, sore throat comes and goes, headaches (mostly when it rains).
Menstrual cycle is heavy, but regular each month. Breast tenderness and moodiness before the period.
Mental symptoms
Mental suffering includes anxiety, chest pain, like I can’t breathe when I get anxiety. It’s associated with emotional troubles with family, thoughts of my future. I don’t feel depressed but my doctors are too eager to call it that and give me pills. ECG report said heart is fine.
Bloodwork
High sensitivity CRP was high, signalling all over inflammation, thyroid antibodies high but normal TSH , T4, etc. ESR also high, white blood cell count is high too. Tested positive for hep A, but my doctor said it could be a past infection?
Patterns
Weather doesn’t change how I feel, but since gaining weight I can withstand cold weather more. So I crave that because I’m running hot. Symptoms are non-stop. Mental/physical exertion makes it worse. Resting somewhat alleviates it. No pattern in terms of what time of day symptoms are better/worse. I usually crave sweet foods to comfort myself. Light sleeper, curled in fetal position. Because of the nausea hunger is less, but on good days, it's normal. Thirst has been less all around.
Family
My mother has hypothyroidism , and father has high blood pressure . Grandmother had diabetes . But other than that, nothing too huge.
Specialists
Internist said depression / chronic fatigue syndrome. Rheumatologist said fybromaliga. Endocrinologist said thyroid disease in the future maybe, but not now.
Anyone have any homeopathic related thoughts?"

"The pandemic, natural disasters like the floods, the Beirut blast and the airplane crash in Kerala may be causing anxiety and depression in many people.

She said she is dealing with this ""low-grade depression"" because of the pandemic, racial injustice and the ""hypocrisy"" of the Trump administration. Michelle Obama made these comments on her eponymous podcast when she was interviewing US journalist Michele Norris, as per reports.
She said, ""These are not, they are not fulfilling times, spiritually. I know that I am dealing with some form of low-grade depression. Not just because of the quarantine, but because of the racial strife, and just seeing this administration, watching the hypocrisy of it, day in and day out, is dispiriting.""
The former US First Lady also added that it is exhausting to wake up to the news of, ""what we're seeing in terms of, the protests, the continued racial unrest, that has plagued this country, since its birth. I have to say, that waking up to the news, waking up to how this administration has or has not responded, waking up to, yet another, story of a Black man or a Black person somehow being dehumanized, or hurt or killed, or, falsely accused of something, it is exhausting.

"Rhea Chakraborty shares Sushant Singh Rajput’s gratitude list, says that is the only property of his she possesses Bollywood News By Bollywood Hungama News Network Created: Aug 8, 2020 - 16:21 IST
Late actor, Sushant Singh Rajput’s death is getting murkier. The actor, who passed away in June, was reportedly dating Rhea Chakraborty for over a year. The actress is currently being investigated after Sushant’s father KK Singh filed an FIR with Bihar Police on charges of abetment to suicide.
A photo has surfaced online which is reported as a gratitude list made by the late actor. It seems like it was shared by Rhea Chakraborty as she claimed that it is the only property of his she possesses. ""This is his handwriting Lillu is Showik (Chakraborty, her brother), Bebu is Me, Sir is my Dad (Indrajit Chakraborty), Ma'am is my Mom (Sandhya Chakraborty), Fudge is his dog,” Rhea said.
In the list, he has written that he is grateful for Rhea whom he called ‘Bebu’.
On August 7, the actress appeared before Enforcement Directorate (ED) for the questioning in connection with the money laundering case. Sushant's father filed a complaint accusing her of allegedly siphoning off Rs. 15 crores. The actress was reportedly grilled for eight hours at the ED office. During the questioning, she told that she paid everything from her own income and did not empty any of Sushant's funds. Rhea's brother Showik Chakraborty, her CA Ritesh Shah, and Sushant Singh Rajput's former business manager Shruti Modi were also questioned by ED on Friday.
The Supreme Court will hear Rhea Chakraborty’s plea on August 11 in connection to the death case of Sushant Singh Rajput. The court had set a date for August 18 but now it will take place on August 11 instead. In her petition, the actress had reportedly stated that the trial won’t be fair if Bihar Police investigates the case.
Meanwhile, earlier this week, the centre told apex court the case was handed over to the CBI. The Central Bureau Of Investigation (CBI), on August 6, registered an FIR against six people including Rhea Chakraborty., Rhea's brother Showik Chakraborty, father Indrajit Chakraborty, mother Sandhya Chakraborty, house manager Samuel Miranda and Shruti Modi. The charges leveled against the six of them are abetment to suicide, criminal conspiracy, theft, cheating, intimidation, wrongful restraint, or confinement, among others.
Sushant Singh Rajput passed away on June 14. He was found hanging at his Bandra apartment.

"Bollywood actress Rhea Chakraborty (C) leaves the Enforcement Directorate (ED) office after questioning within the scope of the investigation of the suicide case of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput, in Mumbai. PTI Photo The tragic SSR suicide saga was raging away, with two state governments (Bihar and Maharashtra) battling each other aggressively and publicly, to control investigations and dominate the case. Till -- trumpets and bugles, please -- a monster was introduced. Enter the Dragon: the CBI!
Meanwhile, the main protagonist, 34-year-old actor Sushant Singh Rajput, has been reduced to three letters of the alphabet. And we remain as clueless about his untimely death today as we were when the controversy broke.
This week, all the loose ends were supposed to be tied up neatly by the Mumbai police, but wait! The Bihar police dramatically arrived in Mumbai to rain on their parade.
The focus shifted to the Cops vs Cops confrontation, and totally idiotic voices started taking sides while pointing fingers at just about anybody remotely connected to the tragedy. Overnight, the spotlight was turned on Bihar.
I was vastly amused by the dramatic arrival of an IPS officer from the state, Patna SP Vinay Tiwari, who made his Mumbai debut in style! There he was, a slim and trim young man with so much swag! I loved his attitude.
And above all, I loved that he kept his sunnies on while addressing the media, even though it was 8.30 pm. He came with bhaari backing from his bosses back home and didn’t mince words as he criticised the sloth/ineptness of his Mumbai counterparts. He all but accused them of messing up a sensitive case, and everybody cheered. Everybody, that is, who is not politically aligned. By now, the case had ceased to be an open and shut suicide investigation. Murder!
They said. There were wild rumours and wilder names flying around. All eyes were on the son (Aaditya Thackeray) of a top politician (Uddhav Thackeray), known for his self-declared close connections to Bollywood.
Bandra folks talked about late night parties and fights, leading up to the tragedy… and a whole new can of worms got opened. What was already a shocking death by hanging, suddenly became a much grislier story -- involving money, fisticuffs, booze, drugs, girls, assaults, gangsters, coverups and more. A masala script, with a terrible ending.
Why can’t our Mumbai cops be smarter? And develop a spine? The thing is -- left to themselves, they are smart, competent AND bloody good at what they do. But the political interference they have to endure completely stymies their best efforts.
Left to their own devices, and permitted to do their job, our police force is second to none. Unfortunately, the political environment being toxic and corrupt, they are forced to compromise, and in so doing, they end up looking like clowns.
Mumbai’s legendary top cop Julio Ribeiro has written often and forcefully about unseemly political involvement, especially when it comes to transfers and appointments in the police force.
He has mentioned an urgent need for police reforms, combined with more autonomy granted to the cops. Does anyone listen or care? In this case, it is obvious how hard political foes of the current lot controlling Mantralaya are working to discredit the government in power and topple it.
Back in Bihar, the stakes are equally high, with elections around the corner. What better than a juicy, high-profile case like this one, to fling mud, make allegations and divert attention from the real issues that both Maharashtra and Bihar are facing?
Surprisingly, the glamourous wife of a former CM of Maharashtra, Amruta Fadnavis, pitched in with her own personal dig aimed at the present CM and his minister son, taking the battle directly into the opponent’s camp.
Meanwhile, the lady at the centre of the controversy -- SSR’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty -- has turned invisible! Easily and smoothly.
Initially, the Mumbai police confessed they were “unable to locate” her or her family members -- all of them in the eye of the storm, after being accused by SSR’s father of being responsible for his son’s death.
Some said Rhea had left for Canada on a private jet, while others scoffed, joking that she was hiding under a charpoy in the suburbs. At the time of writing, she, her kin and two associates have been booked by the CBI and an FIR filed. And she is being questioned by the ED.
Tiwari, the dashing, straight-talking SP from Patna, ignominiously packed off to quarantine himself at the SRPF Guest House in the suburbs by Mumbai’s cops, must have chewed his nails in frustration till he was allowed to leave on Friday.
The other four cops had slyly managed to give everybody the slip and were already back in Patna. Phew! All this drama just to fix Uddhav Thackeray, get the CBI to handle the SSR case, and have the BJP back in the saddle in Maharashtra!
Had Mumbai’s police commissioner been a tougher person, with no political patronage involved (as is alleged), this investigation would not have taken such a strange turn.
The real tragedy is that SSR’s death is being used by so many agencies to further their own agendas.
He has become incidental! What started off as a much-needed debate on showbiz nepotism and how Bollywood can destroy the dreams of people who are not considered a part of the power structure, soon disintegrated into a sleazy crime thriller, with wild conjecture and crazy theories floating around.
The chances are, a week from now, this too will become one more high-profile death with nothing further to push the narrative to the next level. Unless, of course, there is a fresh development involving Aaditya Thackeray -- will he be summoned? People are taking bets on this. Nobody is actually interested in solving the mystery of either SSR’s money, or his horrific death.
Meanwhile, there is a lot of irresponsible talk about his fragile mental health, with publicity-seeking psychotherapists showing up on television shows and disclosing confidential client information. This is shockingly intrusive and unprofessional.
Prominent television anchors too have made utter idiots of themselves commenting on whether or not SSR had “looked depressed”.
Like depression is a “look”. Nearly everything about this awful incident has been trivialised and bowlderised in the most vulgar manner. Surely, Sushant Singh Rajput deserves better.

"The only thing constant in this unreal world is change. Situations change with time and people evolve. Similar situation has happened with comedian, Sidharth Sagar. It was in year 2018, when he had went missing abruptly and later on, in a press conference, he had narrated his experience of trauma in the asylum and finding comfort in a rehab. And that is when, he had also narrated the story of injustice done to him by his parents, Alka Sagar and Sirish Sagar, and breaking all the ties with them. (Also Read: Ranbir And Rishi Kapoor Stare Blankly At Neetu Kapoor In This Rare Unseen Picture From A Hawan )
Just when we thought that things are finally coming back on track in his life as he had gotten engaged with his girlfriend, Subuhi Joshi in November 2018, another storm had hit him hard. Their relationship couldn’t survive the test of time and in May 2019, the couple had broken their engagement after an ugly spat. While Subuhi had accused him of physical violence, Sidharth had defended himself saying that she had left him as he had refused to participate in a reality show with her. However, now, after all the dark phases of Sidharth’s life, finally there is a ray of hope and light of happiness as he has reunited with his parents.
In a conversation with SpotboyE, Sidharth shared that he is back with his parents again and everything is well between them. He said, “I am back with my parents and due to God's grace all is well between us now. In fact, now I have bought a house in Charkop (Mumbai) and we three stay together happily. Last couple of years have been very heavy on me and I saw the lowest phase of my life in personal and professional space. I have realised my mistakes and also that no one can love you more than your parents. It is important to have family and their love with you for a happy and peaceful life.”
He also narrated the story of how he got in touch with his parents and how things got back to normal between them. He said, “I was shooting for my film Vellapanti when I got to know my grandfather (Dadaji) is keeping really unwell in December. So, I decided to take out sometime and go and stay with him. My Mom and Dad were already present there along with my other family members. That gave us a chance to sit, talk and clear all the misunderstandings. During our conversation we realised that a lot of people were involved to separate us and now when they saw we are back they ran away. My mother was especially very disturbed when I left her and now we all are in a happy space. Since January this year we have been staying together.”
For the uninitiated, it was March 2018 when Sidharth Sagar had gone missing and a year later, in a press conference in April 2019, he had made some serious allegations on his parents. He had revealed that his parents were giving him drugs by mixing it in food, and without any knowledge, he was put on bipolar disorder medication. He had said, “Without my knowledge, I was put on Bipolar disorder medication and to overcome that I used to have coffee shots. Then slowly I started slipping into depression. My speech slurred and I was in a bad zone. When I told my parents about it, they said that they have put me on medicines for bipolar disorder. I was shell-shocked when I heard this. I know about bipolar and I didn’t have any of the symptoms, and here my parents were giving me drugs by mixing it in my food. This was also the time I noticed that my mother was disturbed all the time. I had never looked into my finances and when there was a property issue, we realised we had no money.” (Don't Miss: Kriti Sanon Shares A Cryptic Post About Truth And Patience Amidst Sushant Singh Rajput's CBI Probe )
Siddharth had further added that he had gotten addicted to certain substances and to seek help, he had told his mother to get him admitted to a rehab. He had then claimed that he was beaten up at the rehab centre. He had narrated the story as “Four-five people used to bash me and I would bleed and lose consciousness. I was shattered completely. Somehow, I managed to connect with my managers who pulled me out from there after a month. I thought life would return to normal but it turned worse. I would have regular fights at home with Suyash and I tried my best to stay away. This was also the time I had filed a NC against them for I really feared for my life and well-being. It came true when I was picked up while travelling back from Goa and thrown into a mental asylum where I was tortured and treated for ailments I didn’t even have.” (Recommended Read: Kalki Koechlin Shares A Picture With Her Baby, Sappho On Completion Of Six Months Of Breastfeeding )

"Amit Sadh reflects on his rise over the past few years, his defiantly non-strategic approach to the future, and why he dislikes the term ""Bollywood."" 11, 2020, 10:22 AM IST Share this:
Amit Sadh had his humble beginnings as an actor on the small screen. However, he came out of nowhere to mainstream consciousness in 2013 when he starred as Omi Shastri in Abhishek Kapoor's buddy drama Kai Po Che and impressed the audience with his earnest performance as the misguided youth.
Even though the film earned Sadh positive reviews from critics, it didn’t help him professionally.
""Running Shadi was my first film, but I did it after Kai Po Che,"" Sadh recalls. ""It didn't release for three years. It affected my career. I didn't get the parts I wanted.""
The actor had to wait for another two years to land a substantial role in Yash Raj Films' sports drama Sultan. But he doesn't want to blame anyone for it. That is part and parcel of the movie business, Sadh humbly says. He later followed it up with Akira and Sarkar 3 besides the forgettable Raag Desh.
While his nuanced performances in Gold and Super 30 definitely put him back in the game, India's actual affair with Sadh began when he played Kabir Sawant, the stylish and intense crime branch inspector, in the 2018 web series Breathe.
Sadh reflects on his rise over the past few years, his defiantly non-strategic approach to the future, and why he dislikes the term ""Bollywood.""
How does success or ascent that you have had in the past 2 years impact on your craft?
It's like a double-edged sword. Success does boost your confidence. You start trusting your method of acting and then you submit more and give more. But the other side of the sword which I'm very conscious about is that it can also bring complacency. You can become over-confident and lazy. So, I just try to make sure that all the love and praise that I get from the industry and the audience, don't (get to my head).
In Breathe, you play a cop who doesn’t play by the rules. It is as dark and intense as it gets. You just reprised that role. How do you make up your mind for that -- to go in that dark space again? Are you good at detaching yourself from your characters once you have played them?
There are two things: Kabir Sawant is not darkness, he is a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel. He is hope. Does he live in dark times and a dark world? We are all living in a dark world. It's a tough world. It's messy and complicated. And, I think that's the power of this beautiful character.
I'm still learning how to come out of my characters. That's eventually something very personal between an artiste and their art. But I'll be very honest, it's very difficult for me to leave Kabir Sawant. I think Kabir Sawant lives in me.
There is an intensity to-- all the characters you've been playing whether it’s Kai Po Che, Sultan, Gold, Super 30 or Breathe. In a lot of interviews, you have revealed that you were a young angry man who was perpetually agitated. Did playing any of those characters sort of help you channelise that anger?
Most definitely. I have had a lot of healing through the characters that I have played. I often say that acting is a psychiatrist and this psychiatrist pays you, fortunately. Just the whole process of creating a character and diving into your deepest corners in your consciousness and subconsciousness, that's something I really like about acting.
When I was young, I was an angry man but I wasn't angry just for the heck of it. I was not an obnoxious man. I was the man who was struggling with the world which was pretty harsh around me. When I get to play characters like these, I have a bag full of emotions. These parts help me humanise whatever I do.
Have you ever judged any of your characters' intentions while playing them?
I don't judge their intentions but whenever I'm picking a character, I have a few tick boxes which include how that role affects me, the messaging of the character, and the people I'll be working with. But I don't judge the character. One of the best highs for me as an actor is to pick characters which are damaged and broken and make people fall in love with them because that is the real world. All of us are damaged. It's just we live in a society that forces us to look and sound perfect as if there's no problem with us. So, I like doing these characters and touching the human feeling.
It seems that you're not interested in the trappings of being a movie star. You lead a relatively quiet life with your curious dogs.
I didn't come to Mumbai to be a movie star. I'm an actor who has always been fascinated by the art of people becoming other people; creating different characters and how that impacts the person playing the part. And, I'm proud of myself that I'm always away from trappings.
Anurag Kashyap in a recent interview said that the ongoing debate over equal opportunities for artistes without any film background in the Hindi film industry is ""10 years too late"" and today, the audience has the power of validation."" How do you make sense of the whole discussion?
In the early stage of my career after Kai Po Che, no big banner signed me. They thought I wouldn't make it. Did that affect me? No, I didn't care. I don't want a big banner to launch me or make my career. I want a big story and a big character, and most importantly, those who have a vision for that. Unfortunately, in India, all actors and artistes that are not launched by big banners are not considered saleable because they are not part of the big league. That is what we have to diminish. There should be no leagues. There is no A, B, and C (league). All that we do on our talk shows-- 'this is the list of five great actors,' but what about the sixth or seventh? Who is on the 10th spot? Who is on number 50? Who is going to decide that? This has to stop. It doesn't happen anywhere. Our regional cinema is growing so much. Look at the kind of films being made in the Malayalam cinema. Take the Bollywood out of the Indian film industry. The moment we make it the Indian film industry, problems will get solved. My problem is this Bollywood aspect, the few privileged, the few spoken about. That has to stop.
After Kai Po Che, I didn't have money to spend on public relations. I was in debt. How could I promote myself? It's also a thing in India that we run behind a person. We make him the god. So, I'm happy that all this is being crushed. I always say that no person is a god or a servant in India.
It's time now that we show we are the Indian film industry, not Bollywood. And the Indian film industry should be an industry that is equal for each and every citizen of India irrespective of whether they live in Mizoram or Jammu & Kashmir. I feel all the big people who have power are the ones who have to reflect. They have to make the choice that 'we are not going to pick only 10 people and go after them.' It's not a share market where you take 10 stocks and you go all out. This is about people and their lives and their dreams. And, when you butcher or hinder them and don't let these dreams blossom, people get sad. They break. I understand the film industry is difficult but my question is, 'Are we creating a cohesive system of unity or walls?' If there are walls then it's about time we broke them.
Has the failure or success of any of your projects have a long-term impact on you?
More than failure and success, my long-delayed releases have impacted me. Running Shadi didn't release for three years. Then Guddu Rangeela didn't do well. It was a good film though. Did it affect me? Yes, it did for a week. It affected my career for a couple of years. But that's business. We can't complain about it. Breathe did well and then I got Gold so that's a part and parcel of the business. I'm okay with that. It should not affect me as a human being.
You have previously spoken out about your battle with depression and how you even had suicidal thoughts.
I have started to speak about it only recently. But I'm not speaking about all this to promote my films. I'd like to believe that I have worked very hard for my work to do the talking. After so many years of keeping quiet and just observing and watching, I felt that this is not the time to be selfish but speak up. For all the people who are battling depression, I just want you to know none of our lives are rosy but the beauty and the concept of life are that we have to rejoice in this. We have to wake up every day with hope.

"KOLKATA: Subrata Paul might be out of contention for now but he hasn’t given up hope on making a comeback to the national team once again. During an interview session with All India Football Federation (AIFF), Paul, better known as the Spiderman for his heroics during the 2011 Asia Cup, said he has no reason to lose hope after what current Indian coach Igor Stimac said last year. “Whoever has an Indian passport can play in the Indian team,” said the coach. “So, I believe if I work hard and perform then I will also get a callup. If I knew there’s nothing more I can do for my country, I would have retired from football by now but I believe I still have a lot to give and that motivates me to work harder. Also, if Gianluigi Buffon can continue to play at the age of 42, why can’t I play? I am not yet that old,” said Paul. While he wished to play another Asia Cup, he reminisced about the 2011 tournament when Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer had asked for his jersey after the match. “During that time, Schwarzer was playing in Fulham and it was a huge moment for me when he came and asked for my jersey. That incident taught me how important it is to be humble. Later, before the Bahrain match, I went to him and got his signature on his jersey,” he added. Another player who was left awestruck by his performance during India’s match against Australia was Tim Cahill. Both Paul and Cahill later shared the dressing room during their days at Jamshedpur FC. Asked by AIFF what he thought about Paul for the interaction, Cahill said: “He is an absolute gentleman and very humble. Highly committed and very professional on the field. In the game he is second to none. Lucky to have played with him in Jamshedpur FC. He was always working tirelessly before and after his training. For the youngsters, he has been a great idol. Hope he goes into coaching sometime.”During the interview, Paul also spoke of how his life turned upside down after Cristiano Jr died following an on-field clash with Paul during the Federation Cup final between Mohun Bagan and Dempo. “Few well-wishers, friends and family only stood by my side. There were people who started doubting me. I couldn’t train, couldn’t go outside my house since the people started looking at me like I was guilty. I was suspended from football for three months. Naturally I went into depression. But after FIFA gave me the clean chit and cleared me, I started training again,” said Subrata. Although he lost valuable time and his place in the team, the incident made him mentally stronger and it taught him some very important lessons that he holds on to till today. Share this:"
"Streaming The Top 4 Sets From Amazon Prime Video’s Prime Day Comedy Specials
To celebrate it’s annual Prime Day event, Amazon Prime Video has released a special series of 10-minute comedy sets from 14 comics, all shot remotely. Here’s our list of the four strongest sets. Posted on by Suchin Mehrotra
To celebrate it’s annual Prime Day event, Amazon Prime Video has released a special series of 10-minute comedy sets from 14 comics, all shot remotely. The line-up includes a mix of established names such as Sapan Verma, Rahul Subramaniam and Sumukhi Suresh as well as the newer generation of comics including Comicstaan breakouts such as Nishant Suri, Rahul Dua and Aishwarya Mohanraj.
Given the current circumstances, all 14 sets had one thing in common – the lack of a live audience. The comics had to adapt their delivery and approach to a piece-to-camera format that isn’t reliant on the back and forth interaction and energy of a live show. At a time where it doesn’t look like comedians will be returning to the stage for live shows anytime soon , this is certainly an interesting idea. It could also be the first of many more to come.
It was also encouraging to see a (relatively) more gender-balanced line-up which included 5 female comics, especially considering Amazon Prime Video’s poor track record (out of a total of close to 40 comedy specials thus far, only 3 are by women comics).
Having watched all 14, in no particular order, here’s my list of the four strongest sets:
Aishwarya Mohanraj
In her segment titled How To Win A Breakup, Aishwarya appears to be entirely at ease with the format with a set that’s clearly been tweaked for the lack of crowd. Relaying her journey to getting a ‘revenge bod’ to spite her ex, she’s perfectly lands what she’s going for with her distinctive and immensely affable style. Hers is a delightful set that keeps you smiling throughout. Karthik Kumar
More a performance piece than stand-up, Karthik Kumar’s segment on trolling stayed with me the most. The sharply written and excellently performed set is less anecdotes-with-punchlines and more of a theatrical monologue about what drives trolling and how it impacts artists. “If you keep acting like it doesn’t hurt, you don’t lose the pain, you lose the feeling”. Karthik’s commentary touches on some fascinating insights such as how stars live in fear of their fans, worried they’ll one day be discovered, and why superfans are, in fact, far more dangerous than trolls. In a specific, self-aware 12-minute set, Karthik highlights the very essence of the art form – of how one person just talking at you can really take you places. Nishant Suri
Easily the funniest segment of the line-up, the Comicstaan discovery uses punchline-infused storytelling to great effect. With his animated delivery, Suri covers everything from depression and navigating therapy to sexual attraction towards dolphins. While I wish it had a stronger pay off, it’s insightful, personal and keeps the laughs coming. Sumukhi Suresh
Split into three parts, for her segment Sumukhi leans into her strengths by playing multiple characters. The first, and funniest, sees her reprising her beloved character of enraged 10-year-old Behti Naak who offers a hilarious rant against those who claim ‘marks don’t matter’. That’s followed by Sumukhi playing her own mother with jabs at how manipulative Indian mothers can be, before closing with conventional stand up in a strong set about the hellish hassles of women’s changing rooms. All three don’t quite have the same impact, but it’s memorable nonetheless."
"By Nikhila NatarajanNew York, Aug 8 : Three Senators, led by Bernie Sanders, have attracted global attention for introducing the “Make Billionaires Pay Act,” aiming to tax US tech’s top leaders tens of billions of dollars in wealth made during the coronavirus pandemic.
The “Make Billionaires Pay Act” would impose a one-time 60 per cent tax on wealth gains made by billionaires between March 18, 2020, and January 1, 2021.
Riding growing global despair about inequity, the Senators suggest that funds would be used to pay for out-of-pocket health-care expenses for all Americans for a year. Besides Sanders, the Senators are Ed Markey and Kirsten Gillibrand.
“Over and over again, we have been told that we cannot possibly afford to guarantee healthcare as a right by moving to a Medicare for All system – even on a temporary basis during the worst public health emergency in over a hundred years. Well, it turns out that is not quite accurate,” a post on Sanders’ Senate page argued.
“While a record-breaking 5.4 million Americans recently lost their health insurance, 467 billionaires in our country increased their wealth by an estimated $731.8 billion during the pandemic. Incredibly, as a result of the Trump tax giveaway to the rich, these billionaires currently pay a lower effective tax rate than teachers or truck drivers.”
Citing the Americans for Tax Fairness and Institute for Policy, Sanders said: “If we taxed 60 per cent of the windfall gains these billionaires made from March 18th until August 5th, we could raise $421.7 billion. That’s enough revenue to allow Medicare to pay all of the out-of-pocket healthcare expenses for everyone in America over the next 12 months (based on an estimate from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget).
“Yes, that’s right. By taxing 60 per cent of the wealth gains made by just 467 billionaires during this horrific pandemic, we could guarantee healthcare as a right for an entire year. And billionaires would still be able to pocket more than $310.1 billion in wealth gains during the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.”
Illustrative examples cited include Jeff Bezos, whose wealth has gone up by 63 per cent or $71.3 billion during the pandemic, paying a one-time wealth tax of $42.8 billion; Elon Musk, whose wealth has nearly tripled during the pandemic from $24.6 billion to $70.5 billion, would pay a one-time wealth tax of $27.5 billion; Mark Zuckerberg, who is now worth $92.7 billion, up from $54.7 billion, would pay a one-time wealth tax of $22.8 billion and the Walton family, the wealthiest family in America, which has seen their wealth grow by $21.5 billion, would pay a one-time wealth tax of $12.9 billion.
“At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, when so many of our people are hurting, it is time to fundamentally change our national priorities. Instead of more tax breaks for the rich while more Americans die because they cannot afford to go to a doctor, let us expand Medicare and save lives by demanding that billionaires pay their fair share of taxes.”
Aiming to distinguish the not-so-super-rich from their moves, those with net worth of less than $1 billion wouldn’t pay more in taxes. While Zuckerberg, Bezos and the Waltons haven’t yet reacted, Musk took the challenge head on, with a meme. “Everytime the Bernster mentions a free government program, chug somebody else’s beer”, the irrepressible billionaire tweeted back.

"Dear Reader, ‘RBI rides to the rescue’ would be an easy headline for this newsletter, in view of the central bank’s widely expected decision to allow loans to be restructured. But here’s the rub: for the RBI to really step in and provide relief, the restructurings will have to be liberal. That would ensure that firms don’t go bankrupt, businesses don’t down shutters, jobs aren’t lost and banks are, at least for the time being, protected from having to provide for bad loans. But too liberal an approach would just be kicking the can down the road, it would lead to a proliferation of zombie firms and, as we have seen with previous episodes of restructuring, it would store up trouble for banks in the future, as the restructured loans turn bad. That is why we have the ring-fencing of restructuring with all sorts of conditions. Admirable, no doubt, but it runs the risk of not doing much to help businesses or the economy. Given the extraordinary business uncertainties, it will require exceptional banking skills to ensure that only firms that deserve the bailout get it. And as John Maynard Keynes said a long time ago, ‘A sound banker, alas, is not one who foresees danger and avoids it, but one who, when he is ruined, is ruined in a conventional way along with his fellows, so that no one can really blame him.’ Let’s hope the redoubtable KV Kamath, the head of the committee to determine the restructuring fine print, proves to be the exception to that rule. And of course, the restructuring is far better than to have a moratorium brush everything under the carpet. Will the RBI forbearance add to the attraction of financial sector stocks, which have so far underperformed? Well, our analysts argue that SBI, for instance, is trading at a valuation where you get its subsidiaries practically free. Insurance stocks may be a better bet than banks. And some small finance banks may also be an option. While looking at underperformers, we also considered a multiplex stock, in spite of the obvious concerns. And why not look at REITS too? And while we are talking of valuations, here’s a bunch of stocks that our analysts believe either have fair valuations or they’re ripe for a re-rating. But let’s get back to the RBI. The central bank preferred not to cut rates, conserving its ammunition for the moment, a wise decision given the enormous uncertainties as the number of covid-19 cases continues to rise relentlessly. The economy seems once again to be losing some steam, as both our recovery tracker and the Purchasing Managers Index for July indicate, because of the continuing local lockdowns. There are plenty of indications of weak demand. These uncertainties are weighing on people and consumers are in no mood to spend. Far better for the RBI to wait, particularly since both food inflation and inflationary expectations are high. But while the overall mood is sombre, there’s plenty of variation across sectors and companies, as the June earnings numbers show. As S Naren said in this interview with us, we may be at the worst possible point in the economic cycle, but not in the market cycle. Although whether the market has cycles any longer is debatable and maybe all it has are shallow dips that need to be bought, as we argue for companies such as Dabur, Gujarat Gas, Tata Consumer Products, PI Industries and Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals. Global markets have already discounted a full economic recovery, which is why the MSCI All-Country World Index (AWCI) has erased its decline for the year. The NASDAQ has closed above 11000 for the first time ever, prompting the remark that the FANG (Facebook, Apple, Netflix Google) stocks are the equivalent of the Tokyo real estate market in the eighties---at the height of the Japanese bubble, Japan’s Imperial Palace was worth more than California. But that is not what we mean by Japanification today. For that, consider German 10-year government bond yields, which are -0.5 percent---Japan has had very low yields ever since its bubble burst decades ago. US bond prices too are rallying, driving yields down, which is then used as an argument to justify higher stock prices. Gold and silver too are rallying. Bank of America now thinks $3000 an ounce is on the horizon for gold. We used to think before this new normal that gold was a risk-off asset, a diversification from stocks. Things have apparently changed -- Bloomberg Quote: s Naufal Sanaullah, a macro strategist with a New York firm, saying, “If enough portfolios are attempting the ‘financial alchemy’ of replacing government bonds with gold for risk parity, gold and stocks become increasingly correlated. On risk-off episodes, gold can actually fall.” The reason for the co-ordinated rise in asset prices is laid at the door of the huge amounts of liquidity being pumped in by central banks. But here’s a contrary opinion. This week, Donald Trump raised the stakes in the global moves against China by following the Indian example and banning TikTok. We consider here whether Microsoft can make TikTok dance to its tunes. In a totally unrelated development, Facebook's Instagram has launched Reels, a TikTok clone. That’s fine with us, but the trouble with Trump is he doesn’t seem to recognise friends from foes and his order that all government procurement of essential medicines be done from US manufacturers could hurt our pharma companies. As for the US trade war with China, well, China’s exports surged 7.2 percent year-on-year in July, thanks to demand from locked down countries. Here’s the big picture on our ongoing effort to restrict imports. I’ll leave you with this little snippet---according to historian Adam Tooze, The UK recession in 2020 is likely to be the worst, not since the Global Financial Crisis, not since the Great Depression, but since 1710. That’s before the industrial revolution, before the battle of Plassey. This pandemic is breaking historical records. Cheers, Manas Chakravarty"
"Majority of Indians now no longer believe that the Modi government is ‘better’ than the UPA in handling the economy, found the India Today Mood of the Nation poll. advertisement August 8, 2020 UPDATED: August 8, 2020 22:51 IST In bad news for the Modi government, consumers perceive the overall economic situation of the country to be worse at the moment. (File photo)
The global nature of the economic recession caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has led many to draw parallels with the Great Depression of the 1930s. Governments across the world are struggling to contain the economic decline, and in India, major sectors such as tourism, hospitality, aviation, automobile and real estate have been devastated by the epidemic.
So much so that majority of Indians now no longer believe that the present government is ‘better’ than the UPA in handling the economy. Most believe it is ‘at par’ with the earlier Congress-led governments , according to the latest India Today Mood of the Nation (MOTN) survey.
India Today Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) has found that for the longest period of time, the majority of respondents felt that the Narendra Modi government’s handling of the economy was better than UPA. This was evident from the January 2017 survey that was conducted just after demonetisation.
In January 2017, around 60 per cent of respondents believed that the Modi government was better than UPA in terms of economic measures. This number remained above 50 per cent for quite some time but came down to 43 per cent in August 2020. Roughly 45 per cent respondents said the current regime is at par with UPA.
FULL RESULTS OF MOTN AUGUST 2020
The silver lining for the government lies in the fact that in the January 2020 MOTN survey, 30 per cent respondents said the Modi government’s handling of the economy was worse than UPA’s, which has now come down to only 10 per cent. However, consumer sentiment says otherwise.
Consumer confidence lowest
The latest round of the Reserve Bank of India’s Consumer Confidence Survey shows that consumers perceive the overall economic situation to be worse.
The June round of the survey was conducted at a time when India was under lockdown. At that time, the Current Situation Index CSI) a measure of consumer perception over the last one year was 63.7. The August round of Consumer Confidence Index bore a CSI value of 53.8, the lowest ever in its history.
A CSI of 100 means consumers feel no change and a CSI above 100 shows they feel better off compared to last year. Post demonetisation (in November 2016), consumers have never been optimistic about their current situation for the longest time.
Around 23 per cent respondents of the RBI survey felt the unemployment situation is the biggest failure of the government, while 11 per cent called price rise a failure and 7 per cent said the way it is handling the economic situation is the government’s biggest failure.
In the August round, when lockdown restrictions have eased and businesses are reopening, consumer confidence reaching an all-time low should be a matter of concern.
But even amid the economic downfall, consumers still do not find an alternative to Modi. According to the MOTN survey, 24 per cent of respondents rated the Modi government as ‘Outstanding ’ and 48 per cent rated it ‘Good’ in its handling of the economy.
More than half the respondents said the Opposition “criticised the government just for the sake of criticism” . Barely 33 per cent respondents said the Opposition held the government accountable with constructive criticism. More than 50 per cent of respondents rated the Congress ‘Average to Poor’ .
Turnaround plans
The government is keen to bring the economy back on track with its ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ and ‘Vocal for Local’ missions. MOTN data shows 53 per cent of respondents called it a timely event .
Addressing a CII event on Saturday, MSME and roads minister Nitin Gadkari urged industries to move beyond cities and expand production in far-flung areas, thus helping people in India’s rural and remote areas
Gadkari said, “It pains me that 90 per cent of the focus of industry bodies is on major industries in big cities and metropolises. There is seldom any focus on rural, tribal and remote areas. There is a need to change it. Advance sector-wise planning is the need of the hour to make India a superpower.”
The minister also pointed out the need to shift a chunk of population from overcrowded cities to smart cities and villages. “There is an urgent need to create employment, and focussing on rural, agricultural, tribal and village areas, including 115 aspirational districts, could be beneficial. The target is to shift about 7-8 per cent of the population from overcrowded cities to upcoming smart cities and villages,” he said."
"A seven-month pregnant teenager from Shamshabad, who went missing since Tuesday, was found dead on the bank of the Himayatsagar on Saturday.
Police said that the 18-year-old victim committed suicide by jumping into the water, after her ‘boyfriend’ got married to another woman six months ago. “She went into depression, as she got pregnant and Vijay Kumar (28), a grocer, was already married to another woman. Recently, the girl’s family had a discussion about her future,” Shamshabad DCP N Prakash Reddy said. They live in the same locality and their parents objected to their marriage as they belong to different castes, police said.
On Tuesday, the girl left home and did not return, following which her parents lodged a complaint with RGI Airport police. Vijay was taken into custody as her parents raised a suspicion.
Vijay was booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act for allegedly ‘raping’ and impregnating the minor girl. “She was less than 18 years when the accused sexually assaulted her,” police said.

"Matt Phillips Denmark is a place of hygge, happiness and — in the face of a global downturn — a high-performing stock market. The tiny and trade-dependent northern European nation’s stock indexes are easily beating out the S&amp;amp;P 500, which is up slightly for the year, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 and the Stoxx Europe 600 index, which are both in negative territory. The Danish indexes, such as the OMX Copenhagen 25, are up more than 15% in 2020, or more than 21% if you calculate its return in dollar terms. That’s within spitting distance of other market bright spots, like the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which has climbed about 23% on the strength of lockdown-friendly companies like Amazon and Apple. What accounts for such a stellar performance? Experts say it’s a combination of several factors: an effective response to the coronavirus crisis (assisted by the country’s robust social safety net), a collection of companies well positioned to weather the crisis and a knack for well-balanced management. The main contributor to the Danish stocks’ performance is a matter of what the companies do rather than where they do it: Roughly 50% of the market capitalization of Danish stocks is in almost recession-proof health care and pharmaceutical companies — a solid portfolio in the midst of a pandemic. “The mix of the Danish market is completely different than you see in the global market, and there you have, sort of, the explanation for why has the Danish market performed so much better,” said Carsten Jantzen Leth, head of Danish Equities at Nordea Asset Management. Share prices have soared for large Danish health companies such as Coloplast — a major player in the market for colostomy pouches, continence, and skin and wound care treatments — and Genmab, a biotech company specializing in cancer treatments. Investors looking for safety have helped drive Coloplast up more than 25% and Genmab more than 50% for the year. But towering above them all is Novo Nordisk. Worth roughly $150 billion, the Bagsvaerd-based company by itself accounts for roughly 15% of the market capitalization of the OMX Copenhagen 25 index, which is owned by Nasdaq Global Indexes. It’s one of the dominant suppliers in the world market for insulin and diabetes treatments, a business that is well insulated from the ups and downs of the global economy. “If people need insulin, they need it whether there’s a recession or not,” said Henrik Drusebjerg, global chief strategist at Danske Bank, the largest Danish bank. While profit expectations for the wider Stoxx Europe 600 index have collapsed by more than 35%, analysts covering Novo Nordisk expect profits to be up about 8% in 2020, even during the worst global downturn since the Great Depression. Its shares are up about 5% this year. Much of Danish companies’ business — about 20% — comes from the pandemic-plagued United States, but a significant portion also comes from within the country’s borders. And the country’s efforts to flatten the curve and resume economic activity have also helped stock prices. “It was evidently clear that Denmark had got on top of the virus quickly,” said David Oxley, an economist focusing on Nordic economies at Capital Economics, a research consultancy in London. “They were one of the first to shut down and one of the first to reopen.” Denmark has a generous unemployment system in normal times but took additional measures in response to the pandemic. Under a short-term relief program, the government picked up the tab if an employer cut a worker’s hours. Only at the end of June did the government start the clock on its normal unemployment benefits, which pay about 90% of a worker’s salary for up to a year — meaning jobless workers can count on significant support through the middle of 2021, Oxley said. The pandemic did have an effect, of course. Unemployment spiked to 5.6% in May after hovering at 3.7% in February, and gross domestic product fell 2% in the first quarter, the worst decline in more than a decade. But in both metrics, the changes were mere blips compared with other developed nations. And then there is something harder to quantify — the ability of Danish management teams to find a middle path through challenging times. Ivy International Core Equity Fund, seeing the structural advantages of Novo Nordisk, established a more than $30 million position in the stock in June, when it bought over 500,000 shares. And it held on to shares it owned of A.P. Moller Maersk, the Danish shipping giant hit hard by the sharp downturn in global trade. “It’s rare for us to have two names there,” in Denmark, said John C. Maxwell, a portfolio manager on the fund. “It’s a heavy weight for us relative to normal.” Maxwell and his co-managers believe both companies are solid long-term bets — even if Maersk is off roughly 9% this year. (It was down more than 47% in late March.) That’s partly because Maersk, like Novo Nordisk, holds a commanding position in its core market. Even though freight volumes are expected to fall as much as 18% in the second quarter, Maersk’s profits are expected to be roughly flat compared with last year, according to analysts. That is a credit to the talent of Nordic executive teams to operate cyclical businesses at a steady, profitable pace, said Maxwell, who has managed the international stock fund for 14 years. In his experience, he said, different countries can have different approaches to management. German executives can be a bit too slow to produce results, while U.S. and British firms can be a bit too focused on short-term gains at the expense of long-term strategy. But Danish and other Nordic companies seem to have figured out a way to blend the two approaches. “They just generally have a nice tempo about how they run the business,” he said, “trying to hit the quarters, but not sacrificing the long term to do so.” c.2020 The New York Times Company"
