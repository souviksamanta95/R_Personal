I have seen people are not happy with camera quality but I don't see issue with that at this price (I am not saying this is the best camera quality). Just Clicking on camera button can't give you best 48 megapixel picture, It totally depends on skills of the person behind the camera. Camera settings are customisable use it as per..."

"Perfect for the gamer who thinks he's a photographer","Pros - 1. The pricing. You won't find a phone this fast, with camera set up this good anywhere else right now.2. Did I mention how fast this phone is? Multitasking is a breeze. Haven't faced any lag in any games. And the phone didn't heat up that much either. It did get warm, but it was barely noticeable. 3. Camera set up - No, the picture quality is not as great as Pixel 3, but what other phone is? Almost as good as S10+ (I DID have to go to the settings and turn down the saturation from..."

I have the plan optimised to my preferences, and with my usage, it lasts me a full day plus 15-16 hours (picture attached)... Yes! Imagine that!!! I knew that the battery life would be good, but THIS good.

If you upgrade to this phone from a budget 10-15k phone then you will fill the difference instantly but if you use this after using Oneplus then you might not feel the same. Redmi has tried everything to give a premium quality phone but still it lacks behind OnePlus phone in some aspects.DISPLAY: 9/10Amoled displa..."

Just Clicking on camera button can't give you best 48 megapixel picture, It totally depends on skills of the person behind the camera. Camera settings are customisable use it as per..."
"Worth every penny","Bought the K20 pro on the Alpha sale.I was a proud redmi note 4 user for years. still the redmi note 4 is running superbly. but since all my friends have new versions of mobile ,why should I be late.that's why I have chosen the redmi k20 pro 8gb, 256gb version.it's super fast, blazing smooth. excellent performance.camera have to improve by software updates i think. though it's nice but still feeling there is room for software update in the camera department.otherwise k20 pro is awesome..."

"Perfect for the gamer who thinks he's a photographer","Pros - 1. The pricing. You won't find a phone this fast, with camera set up this good anywhere else right now.2. Did I mention how fast this phone is? Multitasking is a breeze. Haven't faced any lag in any games. And the phone didn't heat up that much either. It did get warm, but it was barely noticeable. 3. Camera set up - No, the picture quality is not as great as Pixel 3, but what other phone is? Almost as good as S10+ (I DID have to go to the settings and turn down the saturation from..."
"Mind-blowing purchase","Best among Snapdragon 855Super smoothThank you flipkart for the fast 1 day deliveryValue for  Money deviceLoving it... Never faced any ads till now...Installed Google camera, Even the stock camera is really Good....The pop up camera is next level...I don't know why Xiaomi removed the No 1 smartphone sticker from the box...Only disappointed with the surprise mentioned by manu for alpha sale users....

"Wonderful","Review after about 2 weeks:I'm in love with this phone! The battery life is just nuts! I have the plan optimised to my preferences, and with my usage, it lasts me a full day plus 15-16 hours (picture attached)... Yes! Imagine that!!! I knew that the battery life would be good, but THIS good. I love everything about it, just that one quick reply feature on the lockscreen that's missing, and I'm guessing it'll be a quick software fix, so no big deal at all! I removed all the bloat using the X..."

"Awesome","l purchased this phone during Alpha sale on 17 july and got delivery on 20 july. Therefore, review is based upon 11 days of usage.Build Quality : Feels premium with pop-up camera and gorilla glass both on front and back side. Makes anybody to turn-around for its attractive looks. Feels a bit on heavy side with 8.8 mm thickness. Xiaomi has provided case inside box which is quite good, but it hides the premium looks of this masterpiece. Hence, i applied transparent silicon cover which makes it..."
"Worth every penny","I've been using this Redmi K20 pro for past 4 months. Here are my few observations, pros and cons.1.Build & Design : As the premium phones goes either with Glass back or Metal back, this one goes with both. Fire rendered design below the glass make more attractive. But the weight is bit heftier, although most of the flagships weighs more, so it's not a big problem.2. Battery: Redmi k20 pro lasts a day easily for a medium user. But a heavy user(who can play high end gaming and video render..."

"Nice product","Hello everyoneI am using this product for 2weeks and here are the things which I liked and the problems I faced1. If you are switching from a regular smartphone to the bezel less phone you might love this phone since it's having 6.3 inches IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen.2. Ads on MIUI are a bit irritating but it can be turned off when booting the phone for the first time.The ads however stays in some applications mainly those which are pre-installed and are non-removable.3. Redmi offers ..."

"A great phone killed by an average selfie shooter","Again a new year a new phone. I skipped over 6 pro at it had not much to offer. But Note 7 Pro is a ultimate letdown, coming from Note 5 pro. Before you purchase you must consider the below cons -*** There is no refund policy. Hence once brought you cant get a refund. ***1. Front flash is gone. Your night selfies are a bust. That's the greatest bummer. Rather not have the water drop notch.2. Even if the flash is gone, the camera in the front should have been the same old 20 MP shooter. B..."

"Excellent","Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 ProWhen considering phones under 15,000, the Redmi Note 7 Pro seems more than good enough to suit most peoples needs. In fact, with the SD 675 and Sony IMX586 camera at an unprecedented price, it practically mops the floor with the current competition in the relevant price bracket (again, unless you have different specific requirements).At the same time, based on our Redmi Note 7 Pro experience, we wouldnt go as far as saying that the experience is sure to thwart all c..."

"Pretty good","Redmi note 7One day delivery :)Looks premium,feels good,Display looks fantastic, good colours.camera is quite good and satisfactory if there is proper light.Snapdragon 660 is an already proven tech no complains so far,4000mah battery is good enough. great phone for the price range. Earphone jack Sound quality is good could have had dedicated memory slotcould have given a more powerful charger. as it supports quick charge 4.0speakers aren't great."

"Brilliant","pretty good phone with good cameras and very good performance and good battery backup.worth buying."
"Excellent","I'm not much of a critic, but more of a fair reviewer. I'll put in some details as well. Let's get started. Btw, I have the 4GB ram variant and Onyx Black back. Camera:- Seriously, it is better than I expected. After going through a plethora of reviews regarding the sub-par and surprisingly pathetic performance of the Camera(and recommendations of buying Pro instead), I did not expect too much. But the Camera, for its price range as well as generally speaking, is quite good. Even the f..."
"Simply awesome","Good clarity of images, nice performance, overall good for 12k. worth of penny."
"Worth the money","In my brief usage of around 8-9 days, i can definitely assure you that you can buy this phone, it's just one of the best in this price segment. 1.Performance is just flawless, no issues & i m not a hardcore gamer but a medium player & while playing pubg in hd graphics, it just play smoothly no frame drops. 2. Screen is super smooth & both front & back looks premium & sturdy. 3. Camera is also decent enough for the price, if you are a normal user like me who clicks photos occasionally, this..."
"Best in the market!... Go for it..","First of all thanks to God that i succeed to get it in the first sale and within 24 hours of ordering....:DEverything is awesome including Flipkart delivery service....Let's talk about the phone.. In short it's a beast in this price no other device at this price segment can beat this....I liked it very much let's be in pros and cons...Pros:1. Look & Build: obviously it looks very premium in and feel and look-wise.... Specially Gorilla glass on back makes it premium.... It has very good b..."
"Value-for-money","Good Product Pros. - Nice display, good battery,  good camera,  well optimize, and value for money products. 4gb variant is not so nice deal. Gcam experience is great. Cons. - Internet speed is very slow. GPS is very poor.My opinion - Can go for it,  3gb variant will be a ultimate deal."
"Delightful","mobile are good but back camera not gud but front camera super nice selfie and performance nice and i m happy to this"
"Great phone for less money.","Great phone for less money. Great in one word. Is in charge very soon. Camera pictures are great. However, the phone gets hot soon after playing the game."

"Terrific","Good one Pros : best camera            Good performance           Good display           Best software supportCons: smaller battery           Some sort of heating"
"Must buy!","The first shipment was defective. Phone used to switch off in few minutes on its own, every now and then.Went through Flipkart's call center procedure, which was less comfortable. They were asking to uninstall Apps and do factory reboot. It doesn't make zense, when the phone switches off within few minutes! How can anyone install Apps or do factory reboot when phone doesn't turn ON even for few minutes !! But, call center guys didn't quite understand this.Any way, finally they arranged fo..."
"Really Nice","one of the best mobile based on this price.. i got 12k from filpkart..Please see my below experience on this mobile.1.

Performance is 6 gb ram. it very fast to accessing to apps and within Milli seconds we can able to see the processor and RAM effects.3.brighness also fine no issues.4.charging is little bit concern,, most of them is not satisfied for battery performance. why because 3000mah and pro..."
"Very Good","I can recommend to buy this.Pros:Good design,better camera,better performance,decent batteryCons:No dedicated slot for audio jack, battery back up could have been better,no slot for SD card,sometimes gets heated.But overall experience it's worth to buy as it available in exchange offer."
"Great product","Excellent product. Good delivery with exchange. Got upgraded to Pie immediately. Adaptive brightness problem will get solved through ai enabled mechanism. FP scanner has a great utility of swipe function. TPU case is good and a must. Good for people who don't like that notch on the display. SD660 works efficiently at 6/128 version."
"Utterly Disappointed","No support available and phone always hangs.. please go for other phone model, other dealer.Filpkart good in delivery but providing support information of item(S) is very bad."
"Highly recommended","The cover supplied with the mobile is great but I had to buy one that gives protection to the camera lens bump. This should be looked into in future packages. Also the battery could have been bigger like in your other mobiles. A very good device otherwise."
"Good quality product","Great Mobile, Value for money, I liked everything Except No Face recognition. Battery is Above Average but without internet usage, it would stay for more than 24hours. Android One Awesome. This is my Second Week. I am loving it."

If you are switching from a regular smartphone to the bezel less phone you might love this phone since it's having 6.3 inches IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen.2.

Just amazing glossy design with beautiful gradient bluePurchased this mobile for the camera and Redmi has not let me down.  Rear camera has amazing details and you will get crisp detailed pictures. Night shots are also so natural and lovely. Am not a selfie lover,  so haven't tested the front camera yet.

"A great phone killed by an average selfie shooter","Again a new year a new phone. I skipped over 6 pro at it had not much to offer. But Note 7 Pro is a ultimate letdown, coming from Note 5 pro. Before you purchase you must consider the below cons -*** There is no refund policy. Hence once brought you cant get a refund. ***1. Front flash is gone. Your night selfies are a bust. That's the greatest bummer. Rather not have the water drop notch.2. Even if the flash is gone, the camera in the front should have been the same old 20 MP shooter. B..."

Struggles in low light as expected but improvement is visible. Best in range, no doubt.

In fact, with the SD 675 and Sony IMX586 camera at an unprecedented price, it practically mops the floor with the current competition in the relevant price bracket (again, unless you have different specific requirements).At the same time, based on our Redmi Note 7 Pro experience, we wouldnt go as far as saying that the experience is sure to thwart all c..."

"Terrific","Yes, a value for money android phone. Xiaomi really provide good features such as Camera(you can really see the crisp image), Video quality really amazed me as you can shoot video in 1080p with 30fps and even you can shoot a 4k quality. If Xiaomi would have provided an amoled display in this price range it would be a perfect fit device. Rather than that it does not provide you a 18w fast charger you have to buy it separately. Gaming and file copying are really good at performance as it has 65..."

"Worth every penny","Performance: The combination of 6 Gigs of RAM is enough for smooth running off essential apps. When heavy apps run smoothly.

I know many people would like to disable the notch. In future through software update may be Xiaomi would fix this.4) sound quality is okay. not great and not bad. 5) software : Android pie out of the box with miui 10.6) security patch level is of 5-1-2019 o..."

Device build is nice although front and back are gorilla glass protected and side bezels are plastic but not feels like plastic. Preinstalled camera app is garbage, Camera is excellent only if you use gcam port of pixel 3 xl, working perfectly for me. Display is bright and vibrant but in sunlight reflection is very high. Performance is very good because of good pro..."

"Good choice","Got it on the first day, fortunately I got it ordered.The biggest update on this phone is the usb type C port.First of all the phone looks quite premium with minimal bezels and sleek design. It's little bit slippery also. Phone boots quite fast.Though I am not a fan of MIUI but still it gets the job done.Camera takes very nice pictures, though I didnt like the portrait mode much.Didn't test the battery, but as per specs it should easily last a day and half on moderate usage.The display ..."

"Highly recommended","Here is my first impressions after a few days of usage of Redmi Note 7S mobile phone. I bought 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage variant. Pros: * The build quality of the Redmi Note 7S is great considering its price. The overall fit and finish is impeccable and all the metal and glass does make the Note 7S look and feel in hands a more premium phone. * It has corning gorilla glass 5 protection at the front as well as back.* The display sports a full HD+ (1080x2340 pixels) resolution and has a ..."

If you are switching from a regular smartphone to the bezel less phone you might love this phone since it's having 6.3 inches IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen.2. Ads on MIUI are a bit irritating but it can be turned off when booting the phone for the first time.The ads however stays in some applications mainly those which are pre-installed and are non-removable.3. Redmi offers ..."
"Just wow!","astonished by the features I feel the product is underpriced due to the unique qualities it has.The camera in redmi note 7 pro is one of the Finest quality and love the pics taken from it. if you don't have high budget but still want the best camera phone, then this is one you must buy.The processor is very fast and display is full HD+ quality.

The camera is bit saturated. night mode is worse.Trust me it just some software issues.. google camera is mindblowing  in night mode. camera is still in beta i think.Mi team will fix the issues... But im statisfied with the phone. it does perform well in terms of camera than other phones. and has great performance abilities in terms of processing speeds.T..."

"A great phone killed by an average selfie shooter","Again a new year a new phone. I skipped over 6 pro at it had not much to offer. But Note 7 Pro is a ultimate letdown, coming from Note 5 pro. Before you purchase you must consider the below cons -*** There is no refund policy. Hence once brought you cant get a refund. ***1. Front flash is gone. Your night selfies are a bust. That's the greatest bummer. Rather not have the water drop notch.2. Even if the flash is gone, the camera in the front should have been the same old 20 MP shooter. B..."

"Wonderful","At the lowest end, the Redmi 4A (Review) has been a compelling phone ever since its launch in India eight months ago, and I have recommended it to anyone on a water-tight budget. Xiaomi Redmi 5A design:-There isn't much to say about the Redmi 5A's looks if you've used any entry-level Android smartphone over the past year or two. It's all plastic, though the rear has a slightly metallic finish. Xiaomi says it will be sold in Dark Grey, Gold, and Rose Gold, though only the first two are li..."

Rear Camera is good and can take natural colour photos and it is better than Honor 9 lite(dual cam 13+2 mp)  and front camera is also nice for selfi in daylight condition. Battery backup is very good. Display is also good and clear in outdoor contions. Good smooth performance but not for big graphical games. At this price range Redmi 5a is a beast. You never get a smartphone like this at this price range. I hope my review is helpful."

"Perfect product!","I have to say this is the best sexy looking device that I have used ever. Xiaomi just nailed it. The main attraction of Redmi Note 5 Pro is the display with great in-hand-feel. Talking about the display its is bright(under sun) and gets dim as low as possible at night.Snapdragon 636 SOC is a very much battery efficient phone. A clean successor to Snapdragon 625SOC. I have upgraded from LENOVO P2 to Redmi Note 5 Pro last week. Except the battery the rest Redmi Note 5 Pro excels, battery LENO..."
"Best in the market!","If you are looking for a powerful processor at this price.. You can highly consider this phone.. It has a nice built quality with a sturdy look.. Although I wll recommend to go for 4GB RAM version if u are not a too heavy user.. Because 3k more for just 2GB extra RAM is not worth it.. Camera quality is decent.. Not up to the mark as the hype was created.. But overall it's a great phone at this price.."

Amazing display quality,  amazing battery backup, quick charging takes almost 2hours to be fully charged. Lots of specific features are there. Camera of this phone killer one. What a perfection.

Recently bought Redmi Note 5 Pro 6GB RAM variant (coz I always wanted to buy that phone even in the market best options are available). Like everyone,  I was also confused between which phone to buy? ( specially Nokia 6.1 Plus, Honor, etc..) but I made my mind up and purchased this beast. Pros:  1. As previous MI user I went for Pro 5 which helps me to restore all data as it is in new model.  2. Superb Performance (6GB) RA..."

SO READ CAREFULLY1) IN BOX CONTENT:- We get headset, soft case and charger which of course is not a fast charger, company should include it as the phone support fast charging but still.2) PHYSICAL OVERVIEW:- The phone looks premium and slim the inhand feeling of this phone is also good. I would suggest you to buy gold color as it looks more premium and is not finger print magnet.3) DISPLAY:- It comes with an 1..."

They were asking to uninstall Apps and do factory reboot. It doesn't make zense, when the phone switches off within few minutes! How can anyone install Apps or do factory reboot when phone doesn't turn ON even for few minutes !! But, call center guys didn't quite understand this.Any way, finally they arranged fo..."

"Worst experience ever!","the camera , Android one, brightness are all good .I gave one star for the error in the speaker of redmi a3 ...out of 2 speaker one works other is just to fool around...which why I don't think this could be a valuable thing to buy or assure yo buy for ...,it's like a pixel in redmi ...and other functions are byfar good"
"Super!","First of all i would like to thanks flipkart to Give me a better offer to exchange my phone. and thanks again @flipkart! because your packing and calling response are too good. Second World No 1 Selling Brand & My First time favorite Phone @Mi Seriously I'm loving it. This phone is too good. Camera quality are too much gorgeous.

"Wonderful","I am a normal user. in that sense that device performance is good. not played any big games so can't say how's it perform . but camera performance is really good so as soon battery. so overall it's a good buy. so I will recommended this phone for sure. I have added few pictures taken by it. :)"
"Mind-blowing purchase","perfect device at this price point but display could be better HD+ display is ok , but if u look closely you could see pixels thanks to amoled display that make it up a little , so FHD display makes it a perfect combo at this price point , although this phone is great, games can be played in medium graphics it can handle pretty much everything and andriod one is the icing at the top , if a person having a budget around less than 15k than he should go for it."
"Classy product","Best Mobile phone ever awesome android one and speed is so good I like the user interface"
"Wonderful","I've been using the phone for the last few days and I can assure you that as far as look and camera is concerned it is one of the best phone and looks premium and not like any ordinaryphone. Battery backup is also good and thought display is 720p yet thanks to sAmoled you wouldn't have any issued. Though the inbuilt fingerprint sensor is a little bit slow that is merely an issue for me. Size of the phone is perfect to use using one hand. plz, go for the colour ""kind of grey"". It's best!"
"Decent product","Design peaks, Software was Good. Waiting for Android 10 update. Display was good even it was only HD+ becoz it's an sAmoled display, battery life was good enough easily manage 1 day, cameras are good, Gcam works ultimate, Best value for money @ Rs. 11K to 12K."

"Nice product","Hello everyoneI am using this product for 2weeks and here are the things which I liked and the problems I faced1. If you are switching from a regular smartphone to the bezel less phone you might love this phone since it's having 6.3 inches IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen.2. Ads on MIUI are a bit irritating but it can be turned off when booting the phone for the first time.The ads however stays in some applications mainly those which are pre-installed and are non-removable.3. Redmi offers ..."
"Just wow!","astonished by the features I feel the product is underpriced due to the unique qualities it has.The camera in redmi note 7 pro is one of the Finest quality and love the pics taken from it. if you don't have high budget but still want the best camera phone, then this is one you must buy.The processor is very fast and display is full HD+ quality. In one word it's a Masterpiece guys. specially i love its night mode "
"Fabulous!","The phone is simply amazing. . the performance is great at the price range.. no lags nothing. Battery seems to average, lasts hardly a day. The camera is bit saturated. night mode is worse.Trust me it just some software issues.. google camera is mindblowing  in night mode. camera is still in beta i think.Mi team will fix the issues... But im statisfied with the phone. it does perform well in terms of camera than other phones. and has great performance abilities in terms of processing speeds.T..."

"Perfect product!","Just wow!!! From Mi4i to my all new classy Redmi Note 7 pro. Just amazing glossy design with beautiful gradient bluePurchased this mobile for the camera and Redmi has not let me down.  Rear camera has amazing details and you will get crisp detailed pictures. Night shots are also so natural and lovely. Am not a selfie lover,  so haven't tested the front camera yet. Snapdragon 675 works swifly enough with 6GB RAM and with 128G one need not worry about space.  Battery performance is su..."

"A great phone killed by an average selfie shooter","Again a new year a new phone. I skipped over 6 pro at it had not much to offer. But Note 7 Pro is a ultimate letdown, coming from Note 5 pro. Before you purchase you must consider the below cons -*** There is no refund policy. Hence once brought you cant get a refund. ***1. Front flash is gone. Your night selfies are a bust. That's the greatest bummer. Rather not have the water drop notch.2. Even if the flash is gone, the camera in the front should have been the same old 20 MP shooter. B..."
"Pretty good","I loved the detailing of the rear camera, the most important thing is that it supports Google Camera, which captures a far better and detailed images than the stock camera.(download google camera from 3rd party site). Got this 6gb variant after waiting for 1 month of sale...."
"Wonderful","Waited for this phone for about 3 months. and finally received today.  obviously I'm over excited for the phone. The phone is a good value for money as every body knows.  I always wanted to have a 128gb + 6gb option.  and this phone is best at this price. what I liked about the phone  1)notch which doesn't affect the notification area.  2)  notification led3) crisp display4)  Looks5) processor and ram ManagementI installed over 100 apps to check about the performance. though there were..."

I buy Xiaomi phones for MIUI only. Its buttery smooth. I don't know why people complain about it. The back of the phone looks gorgeous trust me. Though it has a plastic body but without touching it you can't distinguish its plastic or metal. Overall you can't get better than this. Go for it. Antutu score is..."

Comfortable to use, set up was simple, messaging is easy. Typing is convenient. Basics in line.

"Worst experience ever!","the camera , Android one, brightness are all good .I gave one star for the error in the speaker of redmi a3 ...out of 2 speaker one works other is just to fool around...which why I don't think this could be a valuable thing to buy or assure yo buy for ...,it's like a pixel in redmi ...and other functions are byfar good"
"Pretty good","Review after 3 days use:I bought it after lot of research (and choosing between Nokia 6.1+/7.2/8.1, Mi Note 7s/7pro, Samsung m10s, Asus maxpro M1/M2, Moto one macro, etc, and specially for good speakers and lightweight close to 150g) and it has almost satisfied all my requirements.Only negative: screen has a greenish tinge. 720p is good really, and Amoled quality can be seen, but the greenish/yellowish excess is visible and irritating.Satisfied: excellent speaker quality, good speaker vo..."
"Very Good","this mobile are good front camera but back camera not good so this price range to nice mobile its white color so pretty i like this mobile in back sideperformance are good and udar interface change n i like this cell"
"Decent product","Design peaks, Software was Good. Waiting for Android 10 update. Display was good even it was only HD+ becoz it's an sAmoled display, battery life was good enough easily manage 1 day, cameras are good, Gcam works ultimate, Best value for money @ Rs. 11K to 12K."
"Mind-blowing purchase","perfect device at this price point but display could be better HD+ display is ok , but if u look closely you could see pixels thanks to amoled display that make it up a little , so FHD display makes it a perfect combo at this price point , although this phone is great, games can be played in medium graphics it can handle pretty much everything and andriod one is the icing at the top , if a person having a budget around less than 15k than he should go for it."
"Super!","First of all i would like to thanks flipkart to Give me a better offer to exchange my phone. and thanks again @flipkart! because your packing and calling response are too good. Second World No 1 Selling Brand & My First time favorite Phone @Mi Seriously I'm loving it. This phone is too good. Camera quality are too much gorgeous.

"Highly recommended","Here is my first impressions after a few days of usage of Redmi Note 7S mobile phone. I bought 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage variant. Pros: * The build quality of the Redmi Note 7S is great considering its price. The overall fit and finish is impeccable and all the metal and glass does make the Note 7S look and feel in hands a more premium phone. * It has corning gorilla glass 5 protection at the front as well as back.* The display sports a full HD+ (1080x2340 pixels) resolution and has a ..."

Mentioning pros & cons one by one below after 20 days of use.Pros:1) Processor: Snapdragon 730 processor is super duper fast. It processes tasks in fraction of second.

"Wonderful","At the lowest end, the Redmi 4A (Review) has been a compelling phone ever since its launch in India eight months ago, and I have recommended it to anyone on a water-tight budget. Xiaomi Redmi 5A design:-There isn't much to say about the Redmi 5A's looks if you've used any entry-level Android smartphone over the past year or two. It's all plastic, though the rear has a slightly metallic finish. Xiaomi says it will be sold in Dark Grey, Gold, and Rose Gold, though only the first two are li..."

"Best in the market!","Nice product at this price. Soung quality is good. Rear Camera is good and can take natural colour photos and it is better than Honor 9 lite(dual cam 13+2 mp)  and front camera is also nice for selfi in daylight condition. Battery backup is very good. Display is also good and clear in outdoor contions. Good smooth performance but not for big graphical games. At this price range Redmi 5a is a beast. You never get a smartphone like this at this price range. I hope my review is helpful."

Please don't go and compare it to a phone thats 2 or 3 times the price. This is most suitable for ELDERLY PEOPLE  who just wants to use FB Lite, WhatsApp, occasional video call and YouTube. That's all. It runs the Android Go version so that it can try and run smooth on the minimal hardware the price can compile. The rear camera is kind of usable. The front camera ..."

"Very good camera phone for 9000","I am giving 5 star rating even it has some minor issues because I bought this mobile only for good camera within 10k range and I am totally satisfied. I had Samsung Galaxy S8 but I lost it unfortunately and I was looking for a good camera mobile within 10k.My review is only based on camera experience. So if anyone looking for gaming experience, this review doesn't help for them.NOTE: This comparison is based on S8 flagship because I used it for 2 years and still in that mood.Pros:Outstan..."

"Excellent","very good camera. Updated to 9 pie. good battery life. I don't know why people are saying about poor battery performance. It is good with moderate use. Nice sound quality. Value for money product"

"Highly recommended","nice camera quality and better battery backupperformance is also improved from 6Ami is doing a better job"
"Good quality product","a decent phone for parents,grand parents and first time android users...camera - pretty good, I'm using max pro m1 and this camera is able to outperform m1 easily when it comes to photography, however video recording doesn't have eis so kind of a bummerdisplay - nothing much to say gets the job done, ample brightnessbattery - pretty great however mi provided only 5W-1A charger in the box though it supports 2A charging, given the battery is 4000mah it should've been atleast a 2A charger..."
"Wonderful","Its an excellent device for people shifting to smartphone. 2GB ram looks enough. Not meant for Gaming. Solitaire and candy crush will be fine. This device has 19:9 aspect ratio. Having bezels is good for beginners. They are not used to hold drop notch display phones and do kind of mess.Camera is below average but does the purpose. Video calling and occasional photography will be fine.Out of the box, 52% ram was occuiped and 22 GB space was available. There is no IR blaster. Speaker is als..."

"Awesome","Very Nice Product By Redmi. Powerful Performance, Powerful Battery, Awesome Camera, Value for Money "
"Nice","I would like to mention the CONS first. Mi please work out with the proximity sensor. It sucks! (Same thing happens with Mi 6A). I sold out phone within three months. During calls, the phone gets muted, goes to silent mode, opens torch, goes to flight mode, opens notes or dials another number.Any thing can happen during EVERY call. You can find many threads discussing same problem on web. So calls experience is pathetic. Camera is average. Don't expect any thing much from it. It was ..."
