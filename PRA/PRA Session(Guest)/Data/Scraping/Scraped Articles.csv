I-T Dept crackdown likely on VDIS payment defaulters
The I-T Department may clamp down on declarants under the just-ended Voluntary Disclosure of Income Scheme (VDIS) who fail to pay up the obligatory 30 per cent tax by March 31. Although the VDIS came to a close on Wednesday, declarants have been allowed to pay taxes within three months of filing the declaration after paying interest at the rate of 2 per cent per month or part of the month to be calculated from the date of declaration under Section 67(1) of the VDIS.
No cheer in industrial output growth
The incipient recession that has set in during the current fiscal seems to show no let-up or sign of recovery as industrial production during the first seven months of 1997-98 (April-October) showed a growth of five per cent in contrast to a robust 10 per cent growth in the corresponding period of 1996-97. “Quick estimates” of the index of industrial production (IIP) with 1980-81 base show that the growth of industrial production in October 1997 was a meagre 3.3 per cent as against 10 per cent in October 1996. The worst performer is manufacturing, which, with a weight of 77.11 per cent, posted a paltry 4.7 per cent growth in the first seven months of the current fiscal.Follow us on Telegram,

2,2018/01/01/,All you wanted to know about MPS rule ,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/commodities/mixed-trend-in-sugar/article10007593.ece,"NAThe latest deal between the estranged Ambani brothers, where Reliance Industries will buy out telecom assets of RCom, may have made you feel that promoters call all the shots at listed companies.Well, you’re not alone. Market regulator SEBI thinks so too. It has been trying to snip the apron strings that tie publicly listed companies to their promoters, through its Minimum Public Shareholding (MPS) rule. Last week, it allowed companies to use two new methods of share sales to comply with the MPS rule.The Minimum Public Shareholding rule requires all listed companies in India to ensure that at least 25 per cent of their equity shares are held by non-promoters. In 2010, SEBI amended the Securities Contracts Regulation Rules to insist on this 25 per cent public float for private sector companies. Promoters with a strangle-hold on listed companies were asked to compulsorily sell down their stake by making a follow-on offer, putting through an offer for sale, placing shares with institutions or issuing rights or bonus shares by June 2013.PSUs were allowed a 10 per cent MPS, but have recently been asked to comply with a 25 per cent MPS by August 2018. But a review by SEBI in June 2013 found that over 105 private sector firms hadn’t fallen in line and it issued notices to them. Four years on, a few of them are yet to move to the 25 per cent public holding. But the regulator is said to be keen to further expand the mandatory MPS to 30 per cent or even 35 per cent.To outsiders, India has a vast ocean-like listed universe with of 5000 listed companies. But seasoned investors will tell you that the market depth is very low. That is, stocks beyond the top 150 or 200 feature thin trading and carry high impact cost if you buy or sell large quantities. One reason for this is high promoter holdings where the float available for trading by the public is very limited. SEBI is hoping to improve market depth and liquidity by unlocking this free float.Two, forcing promoter to relax their grip on listed companies can improve corporate governance by giving public shareholders and institutions greater say in corporate actions that are put to vote.Three, with domestic money flooding into the Indian stock market lately, money managers are bemoaning the lack of investment opportunities for all this liquidity. Yes, IPOs from private companies can absorb some of the money. But forcing promoters to sell shares can also improve the supply of shares.As an investor in shares, mutual funds or market-linked pension funds, you should welcome the MPS rule as it ensures better liquidity, price discovery and governance in the stock market. Should SEBI decide to insist on an even higher free float, you should look forward to more follow-on offers, offers for sale and rights offers from the well-known names on the bourses.If you directly dabble in shares, you should check on the public shareholding of the companies you own, to ensure that they comply with the MPS rule. If your company is non-complaint, it is in the firing line for penalties from SEBI and stock exchanges. Last October, SEBI asked stock exchanges to impose a fine of <U+20B9>5,000/10,000 per day, freeze the promoter shares and bar promoters from any directorships, if a listed company didn’t meet the 25-per cent public holding rule. Such companies can be asked to delist.It’s good to let go, especially if you’re the promoter of a listed company.

3,2018/01/01/,Why we should worry about the fall in bank credit ,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/commodities/mixed-trend-in-sugar/article10007593.ece,"NAIn most market economies, the disbursal of bank credit is usually a relatively reliable indicator of the extent of dynamism, of both expectations and actual economic expansion. So much so that it is often viewed by analysts as a better guide to the current state of the aggregate economy than quick estimates of GDP that are based on many assumptions and guesses.This is true of India as it is of many other countries. The Prime Minister of China, Li Keqiang, was distrustful of his own country’s GDP data, and famously remarked to a diplomat in 2007 that he tended to use a combination of credit extended by banks, electricity consumption and railway freight volumes to gauge the state of the economy — and this speedily became known as the ‘Li Keqiang Index’ to monitor real economic growth.In India, we know that commercial banks (especially the publicly-held commercial banks) have been in difficulties for some time because of the large non-performing loans in their portfolios, and it is commonly believed that this is what has recently constrained their lending. It is true that until recapitalisation of banks is fully implemented bad loans are likely to have some effect on aggregate credit. Even so, this may not explain the full story.Chart 1 provides data from the RBI on total non-food credit deployed by commercial banks in India. It shows the year-on-year rate of change of the total stock of credit by month since April 2008. For most of the period of economic boom in India from 2003 to late 2008, bank credit was growing at a very fast clip, at around 20-30 per cent per annum. The Global Financial Crisis and its fallout in India put a brake on that expansion, so that the rate of growth fell at the peak of the crisis (in October 2009) to just under 10 per cent.However, it revived thereafter, and even though the expansion slowed somewhat, until late 2013 bank credit continued to expand at a healthy pace, generally at annual rates of more than 15 per cent. But from early 2014, a prolonged deceleration set in, with continued slowing down of credit deployment.This slowdown clearly preceded the demonetisation, but that bizarre move hardly helped: credit that had expanded by nearly 11 per cent in September 2016 fell to rates of growth of only 4 per cent in December, 3.5 per cent in January and 3.3 per cent in February 2017. A recovery to 8 per cent growth in March 2017 did not stave off the longer-term decline. The latest months’ data suggest that credit is still barely growing at around 5 per cent annual rate, but this is largely due to more retail lending for personal consumption.This surely sits uneasily with the image of an economy that is doing well and growing at around 7 per cent (according to official data), although it fits in with other evidence such as the falling investment rate and evidently stagnant employment opportunities. But the sectoral disaggregation of the bank credit brings more bad news.Chart 2 describes the change in bank credit outstanding by major sector — and what is particularly striking is the slowdown in credit to industry. Credit to the services sectors has been volatile and with less evidence of a clear downward trend, while the deceleration of bank credit directed to agriculture has been more evident since April 2017. So the declining rate of growth of aggregate credit was largely driven by industry.Credit to industry had recovered strongly after the shock of 2008-09, such that it was growing at annual rates of 20-30 per cent in the period 2010-12. Annual growth rates of less than 15 per cent were first evident in November 2013, but thereafter the decline was marked and even precipitous. By mid 2016, credit to industry was flat or slightly negative, and the decline became more pronounced with demonetisation, with declines of more than 5 per cent year-on-year in the first two months of 2017, and absolute annual declines in every month since then.Chart 3 describes the changes in stock of credit by the size of enterprise within industry. Medium-sized enterprises have been very volatile in terms of the bank credit received, and have faced declining credit for more than two years, since mid 2015. But they account for less than 4 per cent of total credit to industry. The share of micro and small enterprises is greater at just under 14 per cent, and such enterprises also experienced declines in bank credit from February 2016.The Micro-Units Development and Refinance Agency (MUDRA) scheme, which seeks to reach credit to small entrepreneurs aiming to establish or expand small businesses has not been successful either. The scheme offers refinancing to banks and MFIs against credit provided to MSMEs. There are no interest rate concessions associated with loans under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY), with interest rates on the loans ranging between 9 and 12 per cent.The real benefits they offer are the six month moratorium on interest and amortisation payments and the fact that no collalteral is demanded, rescuing borrowers from the clutches of money lenders from whom they would have otherwise borrowed. Despite this, in 2016-17, the second year of implementation of the scheme, loan disbursements under the PMMY amounted to only around <U+20B9>1.75 trillion as compared with the target of <U+20B9>2.44 trillion set by the Government. Things are not very much better this financial year, with disbursements till December 22, 2017 amounting to <U+20B9>1.24 billion.Large enterprises receive more than 82 per cent of total bank credit to industry. It is for this sub-sector that the deceleration of growth followed by absolute decline is the clearest. From an annual rate of growth of 18 per cent in September 2013, bank credit to such enterprises decelerated continuously, to stagnate at rates of around 5 per cent for much of 2015 and 2016, then fell further to near zero expansion in August and September 2016. It turned negative the following month, fell sharply in January and February 2017 and has been negative since. In other words, for all the months of the past year, large industry has received smaller amounts of bank credit relative to the same months of the previous year.Such a decline in bank credit would be unusual even if actual economic growth were lower than suggested by the GDP figures. This must be a combination of investors’ unwillingness to borrow and banks’ reluctance to lend, but either reason points to very severe problems in the economy.This should be sending off alarm bells in policy circles — but unfortunately those at the helm of government at present seem more concerned about perceptions about the economy than the actual behaviour of the economy and its immediate prospects.Follow us on Telegram,

5,2018/01/01/,2018 expected to be better for steel industry: Tata Steel CEO ,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/commodities/mixed-trend-in-sugar/article10007593.ece,"NATata Steel on Monday expressed hope that the new year will be slightly better compared to the last two years as stability has returned to the steel sector globally.Addressing a gathering on the new year, TV Narendran, CEO and Managing Director of Tata Steel, said 2017 was better compared to the preceding two years despite challenges.
Past challenges
In 2014, he said, Tata Steel had dealt with some challenges relating to closure of its mines because of change in regulations, while in 2015, China had increased its export volumes globally, including to India, which created a challenging atmosphere. However, Tata Steel continued to perform and grew during this period despite the odds, he said.“Despite these challenges in the last two years, Tata Steel has continued to invest and has grown not only in the works but also in the township of Jamshedpur to improve facilities during this period,” Narendran said.Recently, he said, the Tata Group Chairman and board members had visited Jamshedpur and they were “quite happy” with what they saw.Emphasising on the need for competitiveness, he said that going forward, the competitiveness of the Jamshedpur plant will get challenged after 2030, when the mines it has at its disposal today would be put up for auction.
Global scenario
Later, talking to reporters, Narendran said there is stability in the steel sector globally and import of steel from China has come down to five million tonnes from 10 million tonnes because of anti-dumping duty and other temporary measures taken by the government.Referring to the Kalinganagar project in Odisha, Narendran said the board has given its green signal to start the second phase of work there, which has achieved 100 per cent production level within a year of commission.Describing the government’s action as positive in view of demand, he said, the consumption of steel would increase with infrastructure development in the country, and also the logistics cost, which was currently on the higher side compared to other countries, would come down with improvement in infrastructure.On completion of three years by the Raghubar Das-led government in Jharkhand, Narendran said the government was successful in creating a name for the mineral-rich State during the period.Existing users, please   Sign in here

11,2018/01/01/,Luminous upbeat on growth prospects in solar sector ,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/commodities/mixed-trend-in-sugar/article10007593.ece,"NALuminous Power Technologies, a home electrical, power back up, batteries and solar applications company, is upbeat on business prospects, particularly in the solar energy sector.The company, now part of the diversified French major Schneider, with seven manufacturing units, has expanded its India presence while also seeking to boost its export volumes.Vipul Sabharwal, Managing Director, Luminous, said the company closed the last financial year with a turnover of over <U+20B9>3,000 crore and the near term target is to breach overall revenues of <U+20B9>5,000 crore, backed by growth in the domestic business as also export volumes.Sabharwal told BusinessLine that, “We have been growing at more than the industry average and are looking at achieving a strong double-digit growth across various business — domestic electrical appliances, power back up and UPS, battery solutions and lately rooftop solar solutions, where we have adopted an integrated solutions approach.”“About a year ago, Luminous had become a 100-per-cent-owned company of Schneider, after completing the buyout of the residual promoter stake in the company. Since then, the strategy has been fine tuned to address newer areas including the sunrise sector of solar rooftop solutions with an integrated solutions approach, including facilitating finance.”“Such an approach takes away the pain points of consumers as they just have to seek a solution without having to bother to go around from one place to another,” Sabharwal explained.Referring to the government moves to push the solar power sector growth, he said: “This is a huge unfolding market with immense potential. Significantly, the implementation is not just in urban parts but in the rural areas across the country as homes, commercial establishments, educational institutions and hospitals and so on, are keen to have robust and reliable back-up solutions,” he said.The company export business from Africa, West Asia and countries in the Indian sub-continent and the region contributes about 8-10 per cent and solar segment about 10 per cent. The rest is covered by inverters, batteries, backup solutions and appliances. “We expect the latter to go up to about 30-35 per cent,” he explained.For the growth of the rooftop solar segment, a number of factors have turned favourable. The prices are lower than before, there is a growing population that wants to be environment friendly by taking to renewable energy, another segment which has begun to enjoy the fruits of development and do not want any hindrance to their comfort with disruption of power supply, he said.Existing users, please   Sign in here

Starting with the effects of demonetisation in early 2017, the industry faced the Supreme Court’s ban on BS-III vehicles in March. And then came the implementation of GST in July. These periods saw volatile demand for the PV industry. But Maruti managed to pull it off, to bring back the momentum in sales, aided by strong acceptance of its new models.A good monsoon also provided the much-needed respite with improved rural sales. After that, the festival season demand too spurred sales.Last calendar year, Maruti toppled Mahindra & Mahindra as the largest UV brand. Maruti’s UV sales volumes reported 40 per cent increase to 242,465 units in 2017 from 173,746 in 2016.M&M’s UV sales fell to 228,683 units in 2017 from 229,050 in 2016.Maruti has now become the leader in both the car and the UV segments in India.The firm also witnessed its market share cross 50 per cent in 2017. While final industry data is awaited for 2017, Maruti’s domestic PV market share increased by 300 basis points to 50.4 per cent during the first eight months (April-November) of 2017-18 fiscal.
Despite intense competition, Maruti is still an attractive brand for a majority of first-time buyers. The share of first-time buyers in sales increased to 50 per cent in September quarter this fiscal as against an average 42 per cent in the past three years.Analysts expect Maruti to maintain its momentum in sales and market share, led by a recovery in rural demand and support from new launches.Existing users, please   Sign in here

13,2018/01/01/,Ramraj Cotton kicks off 'dhoti' campaign ,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/commodities/mixed-trend-in-sugar/article10007593.ece,"NARamraj Cotton has kicked off its week-long ‘Ramraj Veshti (dhoti)’ campaign from January 1 to 7.The campaign is aimed at getting youngsters to wear dhoti, which is considered the traditional attire for men, particularly in the South.KR Nagarajan, founder Chairman, Ramraj Cotton, said the company has priced a set of 4-cubit dhoti and a shirt at <U+20B9>500 during the campaign period.“We have slashed the price, but this is not a discount sale,” Nagarajan said, adding that the offer has been in the interest of weavers. “There is good demand for dhoti during festival seasons such as Deepavali and Pongal. The rest of the year is rather dull and companies like ours can ill-afford to give weavers job on a regular basis all through the year. Such campaigns therefore are not merely aimed at triggering the demand but also in the interest of the weavers.”“When we first came up with the idea of such a campaign as the ‘Veshti Week’ in 2016, the demand overshot our expectations. Our offer price for the 4-cubit dhoti was <U+20B9>100 during the veshti week.“This time around, we are offering the 4-cubit dhoti and a shirt as a set for <U+20B9>500, which would otherwise cost the buyer <U+20B9>750,” he added.The company is targeting to sell 7 lakh sets (dhoti + shirt) during the week.“It will be available across the 2,500 outlets in the State and 68 company-owned showrooms,” he said.Existing users, please   Sign in here

15,2018/01/01/,'Access to finance has scripted automotive sector's growth' ,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/commodities/mixed-trend-in-sugar/article10007593.ece,"NACall it a silent revolution or a well-planned expansion, the proliferation of banks, NBFCs and financial institutions into the remote parts of the country has played a major role in the growth of the country’s automotive sector, according to a senior executive of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufactures (SIAM).In 2016, off the 707 districts in the country, people living in more than 600, barring some remote locations, had access to finance to purchase vehicles, according to Arun Malhotra, Chairman, SIAM Trade Fair Group, and Senior Corporate Advisor, Nissan India.An industry veteran, Malhotra told BusinessLine that the automotive industry’s current growth of about 10 per cent would not have been possible but for the proliferation and reach of financing options into the country’s remote parts and small towns. Apart from major metros and top cities, a significant chunk of sales comes from semi-urban and rural parts. The percentage of sales in rural parts varies between manufacturers.In the past few years, vehicle buyers have had options to choose from several finance options, including banks, financial institutions and NBFCs.Typically, these finance institutions are located within a reach of each other, or at times located at one central building in districts, making it a hassle-free experience for buyers.“Our estimates show that 75-80 per cent of passenger vehicles in the four-wheeler category are sold through finance options. About 40 per cent of two-wheelers and nearly 100 per cent of commercial vehicles follow the same norm,” he said.“As against a growth of about 8 per cent last financial year, FY2018 is expected to witness a growth by about 9-10 per cent, to close at about 3.5 million vehicles. Significantly, there has been a resurgence in sales of two-wheelers in the country, and we expect to see an overall sales of about 20 million two-wheelers this fiscal,” Malhotra said.“Having travelled extensively over the past decade, I have witnessed significant changes in the semi-urban and rural parts of the country. There is a generation of young aspirational population willing to buy new cars. The availability of financing options and the growth of dealerships have aided in the expansion of the automobile market in the country,” he explained.Malhotra said the headwinds the sector had to face over the past 12 months due to demonetisation and GST are being gradually put behind, and the industry is looking to better times. However, there continue to be certain anomalies in the State taxation structure covering Registration and Road Tax.These also need to be standardised, he felt.Existing users, please   Sign in here

16,2018/01/01/,Fashion e-tailer FabAlley to sustain profits with offline stores ,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/commodities/mixed-trend-in-sugar/article10007593.ece,"NAOnline fast fashion brand FabAlley expects its offline stores to sustain its profitability status as it plans to take up its store count from three to 15 in the metro markets in 2018.With a capex of $2 million, the new stores planned next year will be in new markets such as Chennai, Mumbai and Hyderabad.The Noida-based fashion portal is expected to raise the money through debt instead of resorting to another funding series. It has already raised $3.5 million from investors such as India Quotient and Indian Angel Network.“Going offline will drive more profitability and high growth in our operations. However, instead of going for a Series B, our next round will come from debt funds as we expect to have 12-15 stores by the end of 2018. The money will be used for capex and working capital. But when we raise our next round in Series B, it will be for building the brand and the supply chain,” said Tanvi Malik, co-founder, FabAlley.With a GMV of <U+20B9>95 crore, the firm expects to open its next few stores in malls across metro markets.“We are a prudent brand and expect to get profitable at every door since the focus is on bottom-line and not scale, and we do not believe in cash burn.”Considering that online fashion brands like Yepme have burnt their fingers trying to set up offline stores, FabAlley is cautious while expanding its brick-and-mortar stores.“Last year, we were loss-making, and this year, we managed to turn profitable. Since 95 per cent of retail is about offline stores, having an omni-channel strategy will help us sustain profitability,” Malik said.The comapny has already set up 22 shop-in-shop counters across retail formats like Central. It started its pilot store at 350 sqft, and intends taking it up to 700 sqft for its new stores.With its in-house designers, FabAlley believes it can create affordable fashion by having its own manufacturing facilities.However, it may also seek to import some fabrics from China as it gains scale.Existing users, please   Sign in here

17,2018/01/01/,"Lingerie retailers cash in on demand for size, fit and style ",https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/commodities/mixed-trend-in-sugar/article10007593.ece,"NABeating the blues of demonetisation, lingerie retailers are raking in the moolah and clocking double/triple-digit growth, with innovative products that cater to specific needs among women.Omni-channel lingerie retailers such as MAS Brands India (Amante), PrettySecrets and Clovia are setting their cash registers ringing by tapping the yawning gaps in the fragmented, under-served <U+20B9>20,000-crore lingerie market, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20 per cent, with innovatively designed products that are fulfilling three long pending needs of women — size, fit and style.And going by their growth rates that have long overtaken the rate of industry growth, women around the country, including those in tier II cities such as Imphal, Jaipur, Lucknow, Chandigarh and Coimbatore, are lapping up their wares with much relief and happiness. PrettySecrets, a fashion lingerie brand, which is present in 350 mom and pop outlets and large retail stores such as Globus, Central and Brand Factory, is expecting to close FY2018 at 125 per cent growth and 100 per cent growth thereafter, for the next three years.Explaining why, founder and CEO Karan Behal said: “While most lingerie stores start with size S (small) for panties, we introduced XS (extra small) and go upto XXL (double extra large). We also offer 22 sizes of bras, while mom and pop stores offer just 6-8 sizes, and cross sell them to women of all sizes.”Apart from the white, black and nude colours that are the norm, the firm has an in-house design team that dishes out lingerie with polka dots, geometric prints, animal prints, paisleys, etc, in 40 colours, added Behal.The company does not offer white lingerie. Instead, three shades of nude lingerie will be launched in February, that are suited to different skin tones across the country, followed by six nude shades, thereafter.MAS Brands India, a subsidiary of MAS Holdings, South Asia’s largest supplier of niche intimate wear, introduced Ultimo, a designer lingerie brand for full-figured Indian women, earlier in December, after an extensive market research that identified a gap which can serve 20 per cent of the market.In less than a month, Ultimo contributes 18-20 per cent of the company’s sales.“Prior to the launch, when we fitted full-figured women in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Kolkata with Ultimo products that have been tweaked for Indian figures, all of them wanted to keep our samples, because many suffered back aches as a consequence of wearing ill-fitting lingerie,” said Smita Murarka, Head - Marketing and E-commerce, MAS Brands India.Ultimo caters to sizes, starting from 34C up to 42DD, with side slings, minimisers, special fabrics and elastic with cushion straps, supportive wings that provide comfort to minimise pinched skin, inbuilt cushioning in the hook and eye area, etc.MAS Brands’ international lingerie brand Amante, launched in India a decade ago, is already a <U+20B9>100-crore brand that is growing 40 per cent year-on-year.Clovia is on track to register 80 per cent growth this fiscal at <U+20B9>100 crore in annualised gross merchandise value (GMV), largely because of its focus on everyday basics, the largest lingerie category.“We addressed product gaps in the market by providing basic lingerie for multiple body types in colours for multiple skin tones,” said Neha Kant, founder and Director, Clovia.“Ninety per cent of our 2,500 products are for everyday use and the rest are for special occasions. As a result, we have seen our average basket size increase from seven to 12 pieces per annum, over the last three years.”Existing users, please   Sign in here

18,2018/01/01/,MBD Group to check into budget hotels space ,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/commodities/mixed-trend-in-sugar/article10007593.ece,"NAEducation and hospitality company MBD is readying to check into the budget hotels category. The no-frills bed-and-breakfast brand will be called MBD Express, with rooms priced around <U+20B9>2,000.The first letter of intent (LOI) has been signed for a hotel in Nasik to cater to the pilgrim market. “It’s a greenfield project. So it will take at least three years to come up,” said Sonica Malhotra, Joint Managing Director of MBD Group, who looks after the hotels business.According to her, the country still doesn’t have a true no-frills, budget, bed-and-breakfast. “We want to disrupt the space by going very lean. Right now, what is available is not accessible to the mass traveller as their rates are upwards of <U+20B9>3,000,” Malhotra said.“To make money on <U+20B9>2,000 is not easy,” she admited.“We have been at the drawing board looking at how to minimise our investments and yet make money.”The group will be looking at both management as well as franchise models for MBD Express, she said.“We are looking at a bottom-up approach rather than top-down, for MBD Express,” Malhotra said, pointing to how a lot of Category C and D towns require an organised hotel brand.So initially, the focus will be tier III towns rather than metros.The 60-year-old group has been in the hotel space for over 14 years now, with a couple of owned luxury hotels in Noida and Ludhiana that are branded MBD Radisson Blu.It has also entered into a joint venture with German chain Steigenberger to manage and franchise hotels under the brands MBD Steigenberger and MBD Intercity.The Indian group has 51 per cent stake in the joint venture.According to Malhotra, the first MBD Steigenberger hotel, called MBD Zephyr, is coming up rapidly in Bengaluru’s Whitefield area in a mixed-use development, spread across two million square ft.The development, which houses a luxury hotel and service residences, is wholly owned by MBD Group.Additionally, the company has LOIs for two MBD Steigenbergers and two MBD Intercitys, she said.The group is also planning to take its food and beverage brand, ‘Made in India’, overseas.The first one will come up in London.“We are looking at spaces in London. By the coming quarter, we should finalise a space and will then take 4-5 months to launch the restaurant.”Existing users, please   Sign in here

31,2018/01/01/,The hero arrives ,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/commodities/mixed-trend-in-sugar/article10007593.ece,"NAIt was a movie long in the making and the timing of its eventual release appears perfect. The announcement by Tamil superstar Rajinikanth brings to an end the ‘will he, won’t he’ suspense over his entry into politics . And it continues the hoary tradition of Tamil Nadu where politics has been the last refuge of actors and those connected with filmdom. Cinema has been an inseparable part of Dravidian politics that has held sway in the State for the last five decades. The four chief ministers that the Dravidian parties, DMK and AIADMK, have produced starting from the late sixties — CN Annadurai, M Karunanidhi, MG Ramachandran and J Jayalalithaa — have all been either popular actors or scriptwriters. And this is not to forget other, relatively less successful actor-politicians such as Vijayakanth. Rajinikanth is the latest in this celebrated line-up.That said, there is one big difference between Rajinikanth and the rest and that is the brand of politics that the superstar has said he will practice. If rationalism, atheism and caste-based mobilisation were the bedrock of Dravidian politics, Rajinikanth has promised a “spiritual” brand of politics, beyond caste and religion. His entry is perfectly timed, befitting a hero. With the charismatic Jayalalithaa passing away last year and the consummate politician, Kalaignar Karunanidhi, falling ill and exiting active politics, there is a huge vacuum in the political scene in the State. And Rajinikanth is aiming to fill that.Whether he will succeed depends on several factors. The speculation that he could be nearer to the BJP in political philosophy is not unfounded and it is a huge change for Tamil Nadu to have a leader who is not afraid to profess his faith in God or in religion. There has been an upsurge in religious revivalism in the State in recent years. There is also a growing sense of dissatisfaction with the quality of governance in the State, both of which augur well for his entry. Nepotism, corruption and poor governance have been defining features of governments in recent years, irrespective of political affiliation. Though both the DMK and AIADMK started off ushering in social equality and uplift, somewhere down the line their politics degenerated into caste-based mobilisation, to the extent that Dalits were excluded from the mainstream discourse, forcing them to form their own parties. For a people tired of ‘politics as usual’, Rajinikanth may offer hope, which explains the welcome that his announcement has received across sections of society. Yet, such hopes should be coated with reality for Rajinikanth will be up against an entrenched political culture and organised parties fighting for their survival. While the existing parties have a strong organisational structure and loyal workers at their core, it remains to be seen whether Rajinikanth’s legions of fans will transform into the kind of cadre needed to actually win elections.Existing users, please   Sign in here

32,2018/01/01/,Plan for the long-term ,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/commodities/mixed-trend-in-sugar/article10007593.ece,"NAThis is with reference to ‘What can keep India going in 2018’ by Ashima Goyal (January 1). The country cannot survive on temporary measures like subsidies and freebies; it requires more industrial growth, development of rural areas and creation of jobs there to arrest migration to cities.We need better healthcare, infrastructure and power supply. We also need bold economic reforms, improved relations with neighbours and a check on brain drain. If corruption is checked and if the natural resources are put to optimum use, we will not require loans to push forward our growth story.

Recognise PSB employeesThe salary revision of bank employees is due from November 1, 2017, but the progress of wage talks has been sluggish, creating uncertainty. PSB employees have been contributing substantially to the growth of the bottomline of the respective banks, which is evident from the year on year increase in operating profits. The deterioration in net profit is due to large-scale provisions on big ticket advances, for which field level employees are not responsible.The proposed role of BBB when it was formed has been diluted; it is now a mouth piece of the Government. PSB employees have always been at a disadvantage when it comes to compensation. They must be compensated as per the pay commission.

No need for legislationThe report that nearly 5-10 per cent of the deposits in the banking system have been withdrawn or moved to other assets is a pointer to the potential destabilising impact of the proposed FRDI Bill. The compensation by way of government bonds is unlikely to give comfort to senior citizens who have deposited their life savings in banks and are dependent on regular interest income.In western countries where there have been many bank failures in recent times perhaps there was a need for a law on bail-in. The relevant G20 and EU prescriptions are understandable in this context. However in India the RBI has successfully handled weak banks through alternative mechanisms. So the pertinent question is whether we really need the proposed legislation at this stage.

Big boonThis refers to ‘Increased interest rate for seniors’(January 1). The announcement fixing 8 per cent interest on fixed deposits payable monthly to senior citizens is good news.In these days of nuclear families, old people feel the need to live independently without becoming a burden on their children. The higher interest rate is therefore a boon. If the cap is increased to <U+20B9>10 lakh it would be even more beneficial.

Out of the box‘Tax corporate revenues rather than income’ by Rajkamal Rao (January 1) is thought-provoking. It is an out of the box idea that India Inc should be taxed on the topline rather than the bottomline.This will not only make collections go up but also save man hours spent finding tax loopholes. Thanks to GST, it will not be tough to assess the topline of unlisted companies. But it is easier said than done.

Adjust for inflationWhile paying capital gains tax, the calculation is made after adjusting for inflation. Similarly, in the case of FDs also, interest subjected to tax should be adjusted for inflation. Deductions should be made for inflation based on CPI.

Straight-talking won’t workWith reference to ‘Theatrics to politics: Story of a few hits and many misses’ (January 1), only MGR and NTR were successful in politics; the rest faded away. Translating fans into votes, and to manipulate them is not easy. Plainspeaking may not be practical.

33,2018/01/01/,Agriculture market reforms are a must ,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/commodities/mixed-trend-in-sugar/article10007593.ece,"NAMore than ever before, the country’s agricultural marketing sector is garnering attention and is the subject of an intense intellectual discourse. No sooner did the Centre pitch for restructuring agricultural marketing to double farm income by 2022 than voices of dissent began to be heard. Scathing criticism was directed towards farm expert and NITI Aayog member Ramesh Chand, who strongly underlined in a recent article that it is imperative to bring agriculture marketing into the Concurrent or Union list to benefit farmers. Why is there opposition to a a move that is expected to benefit farmers? Is there a flaw in the proposed reform?Most States have welcomed the proposal to move agriculture marketing into either the Concurrent or Union list from the State list as this will guarantee remunerative prices to farmers. However, some major States continue to offer stiff resistance saying this will pave the way for the death of agriculture and is against the spirit of cooperative federalism.The Committee on Doubling Farmers’ Income under the chairmanship of Ashok Dalwai, in its draft report, justifies the recommendation saying marketing has no boundaries; this necessitates a pan-India operation to meet the demand across the country. Besides, the committee has also recommended rolling out the model Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act 2017 which would facilitate single-point levy of taxes, promote direct interface between farmers and end-users, and give freedom to farmers to sell their produce to whomsoever and wherever they get better prices. If States continue to oppose the proposed reforms which promise to allow farmers a wider choice of markets beyond the local mandi, the losers will be none other than the farmers themselves.The country’s food production has increased tremendously from just 51 million tonnes in 1950-51 to about 252 million tonnes in 2014-15. However, farm income did not grow much, as the Situation Assessment Survey of farmers’ households andthe Cost of Cultivation Survey data reveal. This was also highlighted by the National Commission on Farmers (NCF) headed by MS Swaminathan. The income realised from cultivation at current prices worked out to be only about <U+20B9>101 a day during 2012-13. Why is this so?The National Commission on Agriculture (1976) as well as the NCF (2006) had categorically emphasised that higher output alone will not provide higher income to farmers unless it is well marketed. Recent incidents of farmers reportedly dumping their bumper produce of tomatoes and onions and emptying cans of milk into drains is clear evidence of it. Had the markets been integrated, the surplus produce would have been transferred to deficit regions. If market integration offers a viable solution to the paradox of plenty, isn’t it wise to hail such a reform rather than oppose it?Farmers’ participation in agriculture markets is equally worrisome. The Dalwai Committee on Doubling Farmers’ Income has pointed out that the share of farmers in consumer’s price is very low; it generally varies from 15 to 40 per cent. Studies conducted by the International Food Policy Research Institute and World Bank have confirmed this. The dominant role of middlemen among others is primarily responsible for farmers not realising a reasonable price for their produce, lowering farm income and profitability. This was recognised by the 12th Plan’s Working Group on Agriculture Marketing (2011).The agriculture markets are crowded with middlemen and commission agents. As pointed out by Ramesh Chand, in Punjab, there are as many as 22,000 commission agents and innumerable middlemen in each market. According to Ashok Gulati, former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, commission agents in Delhi charge exorbitant fees ranging from 6 per cent to 15 per cent.The Committee of State Ministers, in charge of Agricultural Marketing to Promote Reforms (2013) under the chairmanship of Harshvardhan Patil, has highlighted in its report that covered and open auction platforms exist only in two-thirds of the regulated markets; one-fourth have common drying yards. Cold storage units exist in less than one-tenth of the markets and grading facilities in less than one-third; electronic weigh-bridges are available only in a few markets. The report also added that the post-harvest losses of various commodities ranged from 6 to 18 per cent. Therefore, they have no choice but to demand higher minimum support price (MSP) and procurement.It is time to concede that production and marketing should march together in order to benefit farmers and consumers. Farmers need to be empowered to decide when, where, to whom and at what price to sell. The intermediary culture needs to be scrapped completely. The seasonal spike in prices of perishable commodities that pushes up the food inflation cannot be addressed without market reforms.Almost 40 per cent of all fruits and vegetables are lost annually in India between the grower and the consumer mainly due to lack of storage facilities, a weak transportation system and bad roads. Climate change is expected to make the situation worse. States alone cannot revamp the agricultural marketing sector, primarily due to paucity of funds and technology. Private investment on a massive scale needs to be invited to upgrade and build large storage and warehousing systems that are climate resilient. However, sweeping reforms will see light only when agricultural marketing is brought under the Concurrent or Union list with the consent of the States. The country will achieve food security only when the income of farmers is secured and doubled.
