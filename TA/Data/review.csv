"1","Finally found headphones which I like!","I have been searching for good headphones since months. Have tried JBL and Sennheiser wireless headphones (both in 8- 10,000 INR models). Have also tried Skullcandy Uproar wireless.Cassette wireless is one of the best headphones I have used till now.Compared to Skullcandy Uproar:  music volume as well as quality of Casette is better. It is also more sturdy and only a few hundred INR more in cost.Compared to Sennheiser: Cassette’s music quality is better. I had experienced that at loud volume, the Sennheiser headphones produced a high pitch which irritated ears. Skullcandy Cassette performs well even at high volume, does not irritate ears.Compared to JBL: I like Cassette’s music quality better- I find it to be clearer.","5.0 out of 5 stars",1
"2","A small overview.","So since it is a Skullcandy, sound quality is on a bit musical side and has more bass. Fit is good and built quality is ok-ish but the ear cups are comfortable even they're on ear type. I received a damaged box but fortunately the headphones are good and working.","3.0 out of 5 stars",1
"3","Finally This Are the headphones which I needed.","Earlier I was using Sony MDR XB450 and tried JBL tune 500Bt. JBL was not at all comfortable so I returned it. So I tried <U+0001F480>. This Headphones are the best compared to both. Bass is just Perfect. Cushions are very comfortable. You can use it for 3-4 hours easily without any pain on ears. Skullcandy will never let you down. If you are confused then go for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars",1

"5","Absolutely delightful","The headphones are really great the cushions are soft and sound is amazing however for 2.9k headphones there's gotta be downsides and I feel they're very delicate and plus not water or dust resistant so keep that in mind","5.0 out of 5 stars",1

"8","Damaged within 4 months","The right part of the headphone broke and so have temporarily used a sellotape to fix it. It's been barely 4 months since the date of purchase. I  have written to Skull candy but in vain. I'd suggest you look for better alternatives in this price range.","1.0 out of 5 stars",1

Now they are giving replacement. Bad thing is there is no return in this product. Stuck with bad choice.","2.0 out of 5 stars",1
